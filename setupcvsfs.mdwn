## Setting up cvsfs on GNU/Hurd - A step by step process
### Description of cvsfs

cvsfs is a virtual (netfs based) filesystem allowing you to mount remotely located CVS modules into your local filesystem.  The version controlled files will appear to you just like regular ones.  If you just want to view one file (or a small bunch) you furthermore save a lot of network bandwidth since only these files will be downloaded.  The usual way to do so would be to check out the whole tree and deleting it after using.

## Step by Step process in installing cvsfs

   * Download the source files from the cvs repositiories

      =[user@gnubox]$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/sources/hurdextras co cvsfs=

   * Change Directory to cvsfs/

      =[user@gnubox]$ cd cvsfs=

   * autoconf, automake and then compile and install

      =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ aclocal=

      =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ autoheader=

      =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ autoconf=

      =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ automake -a --copy=

      =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ ./configure=

      =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ make=

      =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ make install=

   * Set up the translator and start grazing

       =[user@gnubox]$ mkdir -p cvsfs_test= // For testing the cvsfs file system
   
       =[user@gnubox cvsfs]$ settrans -a cvsfs_test /hurd/cvsfs cvs.sourceforge.net /cvsroot/projectname modulename=
  
 *  Example to mount the cvsfs module on hurdextras to a local directory

       =[user@gnubox]$ mkdir cvs.d=

       =[user@gnubox]$ settrans -ac cvs.d/cvsfs /hurd/cvsfs cvs.savannah.nongnu.org sources/hurdextras cvsfs=

_Now change to that directory and start using ls, emacs, and whatever you feel like :-) Happy Hacking._
