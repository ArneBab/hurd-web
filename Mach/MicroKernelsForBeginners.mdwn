Think of this as a Wiki Pos^H^H^H Yellow Sticky Note Note

This page is linked to from [[Mach]]. I created it for the purpose of creating a 'beginners meta guide to microkernels'.

Essentially, the rationale is as follows. There are many users of this Wiki who understand microkernels. Many users who come here may want to know more about microkernels, having just heard about them. (I heard years ago, but haven't taken a direct interest in the issues related to them.)

As a suggestion as to what should go here:

* Good books to read
* Good websites to visit
* Any easy to read papers concerning the topic

...you get the idea.

nb. The above text is intended as a placeholder for actual content, which I cannot supply myself but think should go here. (Rationale is a reverse application of the 'do unto others...', namely I am most likely not the only thinking this and registering the initial suggestion may help as a catalyst to helping others...)
