A group of one being led by Neal H. Walfield is working on porting the Hurd to the pistachio version of the L4 microkernel. This second generation microkernel provides a significantly different API than the one offered by the Mach microkernel, a first generation microkernel. One of the primary goals of the project, outside of porting the Hurd to L4, is to reevaluate the current Hurd abstractions and consider how they can be modified to be more general.

I have no web page describing my efforts. There is a mailing list[1].

Neal noted [1] that there are licensing issues being worked out so no code is yet released. His work was performed in the summer of 2002 at Karlsruhe.

There are several important pages that are of interest for the L4 &amp; hurd communities.

* Main L4 home page - <http://www.l4ka.org/>
* Hurd on L4 - <http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/l4hurd/>
* Hurd on L4 - <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/l4hurd/>

There was [discussion in October 2002](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/l4-hurd/2002-October/000727.html) about the differences between Hurd on Mach and Hurd on L4 with some interesting URLs. In the thread Okuji [responds](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/l4-hurd/2002-October/000728.html) confirming his document is two years old and outdated by the directions that Neal is taking in furthering this effort. The URLs in that email might be helpful to those learning more about Hurd and L4 ideas that were considered yet abandoned.
