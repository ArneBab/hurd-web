OSKit Mach was a branch off of the [[GnuMach]] kernel, but since the release of [[GnuMach]] 1.3, OSKit Mach has been merged as the new [[GnuMach]] 2.x mainline. It makes use of the drivers provided by [the OSKit](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/) from [the Flux Research Group](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/).

The OSKit provides a neat driver base where both [[FreeBSD]] and Linux (2.2.12) drivers are made available to [Mach](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html) and thus the Hurd.

Here is a [[OskitMachStatusList]] on what is required before a full conversion of the project to using oskit.

There's also an effort at an [Oskit Mach Alpha Port](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnumach-alpha/).

First you need to get the latest OSKit and the oskit-mach stuff. Take a look at the following [tutorial](http://www.etherhogz.org/doc/oskit-mach.html) to get started. Or the locally kept brief version, [[BuildingOskitMach]].

## <a name="Debugging"> Debugging </a>

Igor Khavkine's, , excellent help to [remote debug oskit-mach over a serial line](http://www.etherhogz.org/doc/oskit-boot.txt), or the local [[RemoteDebugOskitMach]].

You can also, to some extent, run a [http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/howto/subhurd.html]\[Neighbor Hurd]] (sub-hurd) to debug or replicate problems.
