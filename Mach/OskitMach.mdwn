## <a name="About"> About </a>

OSKit-Mach began as a branch of the [[Mach/GnuMach]] 1.2 kernel, but since the release of GNU Mach 1.3, OSKit-Mach has been merged as the new [[Mach/GnuMach]] 2.x mainline. The [[Mach/MachHistory]] page tells a more interesting story including other operating systems who use Mach in their kernels.

GNU Mach 2.0 makes use of the drivers provided by [the OSKit](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/) from [the Flux Research Group](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/). The OSKit provides a neat driver base where both [[Hurd/FreeBSD]] and Linux (2.2.12) drivers are made available to [Mach](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html) and thus the Hurd.

## <a name="Status"> Status </a>

The [[OskitMachStatusList]] tells what is required before GNUmach 2.0 (a.k.a. OSKit-Mach) goes mainstream. Status of the new console/term is on that page. The [[Hurd/MailLists]], or the [[Hurd/HurdIRC]] is, like always, the best source of more current information.

There's also other efforts

* [OSKit-Mach Alpha Port](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnumach-alpha/).
* [OSKit-Mach [[PowerPC]] port](http://huizen.dds.nl/~pjbruin/hurd/)

First you need to get the latest OSKit and the oskit-mach stuff. Take a look at the following [tutorial](http://www.etherhogz.org/doc/oskit-mach.html) to get started. Or the locally kept brief version, [[BuildingOskitMach]].

## <a name="Debugging"> Debugging </a>

Igor Khavkine's, , excellent help to [remote debug oskit-mach over a serial line](http://www.etherhogz.org/doc/oskit-boot.txt), or the local [[RemoteDebugOskitMach]].

You can also, to some extent, run a [Neighbor Hurd](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/howto/subhurd.html) (sub-hurd) to debug or replicate problems.
