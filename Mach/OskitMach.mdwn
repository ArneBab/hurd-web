OSKit Mach is a branch off of the [[GnuMach]] kernel which makes use of the underpinnings provided by [the OSKit](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/) from [the Flux Research Group](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/).

The OSKit provides a neat driver base where both [[FreeBSD]] adn Linux (2.2.12) drivers are made available to [Mach](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html) and thus the Hurd.
