# CPU Architecture

GNU Mach current only supports the x86 architecture.

# Memory

GNU Mach supports a maximum of 1GB of memory.  If your system has
more, add the following to the start of your Grub stanza to boot
the Hurd:

    uppermem 1232896

# Video Cards

Debian distributes a version of Xorg.  If your video card driver
depends on a special kernel interface such as that provided by
the agpgart kernel module for the Linux kernel, then your video
card will only be supported by the Vesa driver.

# Sound

No sound cards are supported at this time.

# USB

USB is not support at this time.

# Storage

IDE Drives are known to work.  SATA drives work in compatibility mode.
