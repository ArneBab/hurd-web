Mach has quite a history.

GNU took over the maintenance of Mach. OSKit Mach began as a branch of the [[GnuMach]] 1.2 kernel, but since the release of GNU Mach 1.3, [[OskitMach]] has been merged as the new GNU Mach 2.x mainline.

Apple's Macintosh OSX (OS 10.x) is based on [Darwin](http://www.apple.com/macosx/technologies/darwin.html). _"Darwin uses a monolithic kernel based on [[FreeBSD]] 4.4 and the OSF/mk Mach 3."_ Darwin also has a [Kernel Programming](http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Darwin/General/KernelProgramming/About/index.html) Book.
