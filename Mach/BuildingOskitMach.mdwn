This is a brief Building OSKit Mach HowTO. It covers everything from getting the latest sources of both the [OSKit](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/) and the OSKit branch of the GNUmach kernel. There is also [another guide](http://www.etherhogz.org/doc/oskit-mach.html). Down to building and debugging them. On May 27 after the [[GnuMach]] 1.3 release, Roland McGrath merged OSKit Mach in the [[GnuMach]] 2.x mainline.

## <a name="Getting_your_hands_on_the_source"> Getting your hands on the source </a>

First you need to checkout the relevant sources.

### <a name="Accessing_the_FLUX_groups_CVS_or"> </a> Accessing the FLUX groups' CVS, or FTP

You can use either the bleeding edge OSKit from CVS, or the latest public release. The latter is preferrable!

**_CVS:_**

      CVSROOT=":pserver:anoncvs@leak.cs.utah.edu:/cvs"
      CVS_RSH=ssh
      cvs -z3 co oskit

**_FTP:_** St. Patricks day 2002 release: <ftp://flux.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/oskit-20020317.tar.gz>

Valentine's day 2001 release: <ftp://flux.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/oskit-20010214.tar.gz>

### <a name="Accessing_the_GNU_CVS"> </a> Accessing the GNU CVS

The recommended document for accessing the Hurd CVS on [Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org) is at

This is only a brief restatement, which may ormay not be accurate. Setup your environment with the CVSROOT variable. How you do this may differ between shells.

      CVSROOT=":pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/hurd"

**_Gnu Mach:_**

All development, apart from critical bug fixes, is done on the upcoming 2.0 release. Previously the oskit-branch of gnumach.

      cvs -z3 co -d gnumach

In case you have been tracking the oskit-branch and want to move to the current HEAD branch you can issue the following instead to update your tree.

      cvs -z3 update -r HEAD -Pd

**_The Hurd servers:_**

In case you want to build the Hurd servers as well, you can check them out too:

      cvs -z3 co hurd

**_Inteface generator:_**

See the [[MachInterfaceGenerator]] for more information.

Check it out using

      cvs -z3 co mig

### <a name="The_OSKit"> </a> The OSKit

The attached [[ATTACHURLmodulesx86pc]] file is my personal setup, it works for me. Now, how to configure and build the OSKit.

**_Configuring:_**

    # cd oskit-20020317/
    # mkdir build
    # cd build
    # ../configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-debug

**_Building:_**

    # make
    # sudo make install

### <a name="OSKit_Mach"> </a> OSKit Mach

To build any Mach kernel you need an interface generator, a mig. If your host system is Debian based you can get the "Cheap cross-compuler for GNU/Hurd" with a simple:

    $ apt-get gcc-i386-gnu

This will install the i386-gnu-mig in /usr/bin for you.

**_Configuring:_**

    # cd oskit-mach
    # mkdir build
    # cd build
    # CFLAGS="-g" MIG=i386-gnu-mig OSKIT_LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/oskit ../configure --prefix=/gnu --enable-debug

**_Building:_**

    # make
    # sudo make install
    # sudo gzip /gnu/boot/oskit-mach
