The only thing that is needed before we will switch to the OSKit-Mach variant of GNU Mach is the missing console: OSKit-Mach has no console in the kernel, so we need an implementation in userspace. Marcus Brinkmann is writing a console implementation with a client-server design, Unicode support and lots of other goodies. The server is working, the ncurses client is working (which is useful for testing and results in something similar to screen) and the VGA client is the one missing component. A part of the code for it already exists; it will share some code with the ncurses client via a console-client library. After it works, some testing of OSKit-Mach will also be needed.

There was quite a bit of coding and testing in September as described in several [bug-hurd threads](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-September/thread.html).

Unfortunately this work still needs to be ported fromGNU Mach 1.3 (commonly used today) to Mach 2.0 with oskit.
