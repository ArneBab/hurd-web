Here is the only list I am aware of that shows the status of the "imminent" conversion to [[OskitMach]] for the whole Debian GNU/Hurd project.

* console (in progress - marcus)
* other bugs (see the [bug-hurd archives](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/) for detailed information)
  * for example, on my machine it won't boot past the initial couple of lines where the kernel loads itself. It then immediately reboots.
