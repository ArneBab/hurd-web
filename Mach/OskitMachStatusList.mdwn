Here is the only list I am aware of that shows the status of the "imminent" conversion to [[OskitMach]] for the whole Debian GNU/Hurd project. These are only the "show stopper" problems, ones that are serious enough to prevent the transition from taking place.

* console (in progress - marcus)

* posix threads (in progress - jbailey)

* shared memory

* posix record locking

* semaphores

* other bugs (see the [bug-hurd archives](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/), [gnumach](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=gnumach), [oskit](http://packages.debian.org/oskit) and [hurd](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=hurd) for detailed information)
