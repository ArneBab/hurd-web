# <a name="Building_GNUMach_GNU_Mach_from_S"> </a> Building [[GNUMach]] from Source

If you want to build the [[GNUMach]] kernel yourself instead of just using a pre-built binary, follow these instructions.

The unpacked source tree is around 20 MiB, and the build tree (with all drivers enabled) is around 50 MiB.

See [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-download.html#cvs).

    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/hurd co -r gnumach-1-branch gnumach

(Most probably you want to get hold of the _GNU Mach 1 branch_ and not the trunk, which is also what we've done above.)

You then have to create the automatically generatable files:

    $ ( cd gnumach && autoreconf --install )

See [here](http://packages.debian.net/source/unstable/gnumach).

    $ apt-get source gnumach

Please see [[Distrib/DebianFAQ]] before using _apt-get source_.

Building GNU Mach requires the _build-essential_ and _fakeroot_ packages, their dependencies and additional packages that are specified by the source gnumach package:

    # apt-get install build-essential fakeroot
    # apt-get build-dep gnumach

### <a name="_on_non_Debian_systems"> ... on non-Debian systems </a>

Apart from the case that you only want to install GNU Mach's header files (see below), building GNU Mach requires you to have the Mach Interface Generator installed. See [[Mig/BuildingMIG]] about how to do that, then come back here.

Additionally, building GNU Mach requires a C compiler, a standard C library and your favourite flavor of awk (gawk) and GNU make.

## <a name="Building_and_Installing"> Building and Installing </a>

### <a name="_Debian_deb_files"> ... Debian _.deb_ files </a>

Change into the directory with the downloaded / unpacked _gnumach_ sources, e.g.

    $ cd gnumach-20050801

Start the build process with

    $ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -rfakeroot

[[GNUMach]] is now building. To use the new kernel, you must install the resulting _.deb_ package which is located one directory above the build directory and has a similar name as the build directory, e.g.

    # dpkg -i ../gnumach_20050801-4_hurd-i386.deb

You can now reboot your computer and enjoy the new kernel.

### <a name="_TODO_"> [TODO] </a>

GNU Mach should be built in a separate directory:

    $ mkdir gnumach-build
    $ cd gnumach-build

Find the path to your GNU Mach sources (_[...]/gnumach-1-branch_) and configure it:

    $ [...]/gnumach-1-branch/configure [TODO]

Build the kernel image:

    $ make gnumach.gz

Optionally run the (tiny) test suite:

    $ make check

You can then install and use _gnumach.gz_.

[TODO.]

### <a name="Installing_only_the_Header_Files"> Installing only the Header Files </a>

GNU Mach should be built in a separate directory:

    $ mkdir gnumach-build
    $ cd gnumach-build

Find the path to your GNU Mach sources (_[...]/gnumach-1-branch_) and configure it:

    $ [...]/gnumach-1-branch/configure --prefix=

Install the header files into e.g. _~/gnu/include/_:

    $ make DESTDIR=~/gnu install-data
