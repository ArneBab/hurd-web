# <a name="Building_GNUMach_from_source_fro"> </a> Building GNUMach from source from the Debian repository

If you've already installed Debian/Hurd an you want to compile the GNUMach kernel from source (from the Debian repository) instead of installing the binary, follow this instructions.

You can also build GNUMach from Debian GNU/Linux, extract the kernel from the resulting deb-file and then copy the compressed gnumach-kernel onto your GNU/Hurd partition to /boot/gnumach.gz.

First, make sure, this line is included in your /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main

Install additional needed packages

    #apt-get update
    #apt-get build-dep gnumach

Load the sources from the Debian repository (the source usually differs to the source in the official FSF repository)

    #apt-get source gnumach

Building GNUmach

Change into the directory with the downloaded gnumach source, e. g.

    $cd ~/gnumach-20050801

Start the build process with

    $dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -rfakeroot

GNUMach is built then. To use the new kernel, you must install the resulting deb-package, with can be found one directory above the build directory and has a similar name like the built package (gnumach\_\*hurd-i386.deb), e.g.:

    dpkg -i ../gnumach_20050801-4_hurd-i386.deb

No you can reboot your computer and enjoy the new kernel.
