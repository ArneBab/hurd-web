# <a name="Building_GNUMach_GNU_Mach_from_S"> </a> Building [[GNUMach]] from Source

If you want to build the [[GNUMach]] kernel yourself instead of just using a pre-built binary, follow these instructions.

## <a name="Getting_the_Source_Code"> Getting the Source Code </a>

You can chose between getting the [sources from the developers's RCS](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-download.html#cvs):

    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/hurd co -r gnumach-1-branch gnumach

(Most probably you want to get hold of the _GNU Mach 1 branch_ and not the trunk, which is also what we've done above.)

... or (if you are working on a Debian system) the ones that are used for the [current Debian gnumach package](http://packages.debian.net/source/unstable/gnumach):

    $ apt-get source gnumach

Please see [[Distrib/DebianFAQ]] before using _apt-get source_.

The unpacked source tree is around [TODO]MiB, and the build tree (with all drivers enabled) is around [TODO]MiB.

Building GNU Mach requires the _build-essential_ and _fakeroot_ packages, their dependencies and additional packages that are specified by the source gnumach package:

    # apt-get install build-essential fakeroot
    # apt-get build-dep gnumach

### <a name="_deb_files"> ... _.deb_ files </a>

Change into the directory with the downloaded / unpacked gnumach sources, e.g.

    $ cd gnumach-20050801

Start the build process with

    $ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -rfakeroot

### <a name="_TODO_"> [TODO] </a>

[TODO]

[[GNUMach]] is now building. To use the new kernel, you must install the resulting _.deb_ package which is located one directory above the build directory and has a similar name as the build directory, e.g.

    # dpkg -i ../gnumach_20050801-4_hurd-i386.deb

You can now reboot your computer and enjoy the new kernel.
