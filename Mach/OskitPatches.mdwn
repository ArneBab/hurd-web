## <a name="OSKit_2001_02_14"> </a> OSKit 2001-02-14

These are extra patches for people who, for some reason, use the 2001 version of the OSKit.

* Patrick Tullman [[ATTACHURLpatch-oskit-097-tullmandiffgz]]

* This patch is necessary to get the `--enable-indirect-osenv` flag to the configure script. The flag is enabled by default for OSKit 2002-03-17 and later. Kevin Kraemer [[ATTACHURLpatch-oskit-097-kkraemerdiffgz]]

**_Critical Patches:_**

Here are the patches critical to get [[OskitMach]] running. These are absolutely essential to get a working Mach kernel. Many of these patches are included with the Debian distribution of the OSKit.

* Igor Khavkine [[ATTACHURLpatch-oskit-097-i_khavkidiffgz]]

* Famous removal of only one line in sbrk-hack.c - needed for people with newer libc's (e.g. Debian Woody) [[ATTACHURLpatch-oskit-097-sbrk_hackdiffgz]]

* Jonathan S. Arney - Important patch to diskpart library. Without it you cannot activate swap in oskit-mach. [[ATTACHURLpatch-oskit-097-jon_arneydiffgz]]

* Richard Kreuter's [patches](http://anduril.rutgers.edu/richard/oskit/) ([announcement](ftp://flux.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/mail/html/oskit-users/msg01560.html)). Needed when your Hurd partition is embedded inside an extended partition created by Windows. The patches also include:
  * support for extended partitions with lba
  * support for 16-entry BSD disklabels, as are supported by recent Net- and [[FreeBSD]] kernels.
  * support for the recognition of [[NetBSD]]'s slice id (169) in the BIOS partition table.

**_Cosmetic Patches:_**

* Kevin Kraemer - Removes annoying debug output from eepro.c driver. [[ATTACHURLpatch-oskit-097-eeprodiffgz]]

* Ognyan Kulev - Reduce warnings when compiling with GCC 3.2. <http://debian.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/~ogi/hurd/oskit/>

**_New Functionality:_**

* Daniel Wagner - PCMCIA support. <http://www.vis.ethz.ch/~wagi/oskit/> ([instructions](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-November/010956.html))
