Interesting, for consistency sake I'll think about making your changes you made on the right hand side to the other web WebHome pages. I guess it's not critical that they are identical, but I was trying to keep them identical if possible. I also wanted it to be "light" enough feature wise that it doesn't overpower the page. You've added back a few of the features, so we obviously differ in how important you and I think these features are. That's OK, I'll think about it some more and we'll see what happens.

Oh, I see you added back [[WebTopicList]] and [[WebPreferences]]. I purposely removed [[WebPreferences]] from the lists on the right because it has nothing to do with navigation. I also didn't think that people actually use topic names to navigate. If they do they could search for them. Keeping the number to four items instead of six and keeping the descriptions concise makes a big difference when I view the page.

(goes off to think more...)

and eat... ;-)
