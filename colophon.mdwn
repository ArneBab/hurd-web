Just like a book, this topic is designed to help describe the tools used to
create this website and what methods were used to give it its look and feel.


What we see today is the junction of two different branches: the original
static HTML pages and the wiki pages.

# Static HTML Pages

In November 2008, the Hurd's old static web pages were merged into the wiki
pages' repository.  After a lot of cleansing work, on 2008-11-22 the joined set
of pages was made available for serving the official GNU Hurd web appearance at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/>.

# Wiki Pages

## Rev. I

We used a particular implementation (or clone) of Wiki software called
[TWiki](http://twiki.org).  The wiki was reachable at
`http://hurd.gnufans.org/`.

A generic [WikiWikiWeb](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors), or simply
Wiki, is _"a collaborative forum where people can share ideas and record any
consensus reached on difficult issues, along with rebuttal.  It changes as
people come and go, as experience develops, and as opinions change."  The TWiki
software is an enhanced descendent of the original WikiWikiWeb_.

We used the [GNU Skin](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/GnuSkin).

The site began in May 2002 as one TWiki web: *Hurd*.  This WebHome page was
used as the front page of the whole site.  We grew this site and added more
TWiki webs by December 2002.  Due to the success of the site we had to act
with respect to more completely addressing copyright issues.  More people
started adding content.

The gnufans site's administrators would eventually step back from maintenance
of their wiki installation, so from roughly 2005 on, day-to-day tasks like
processing new user's registrations or spam removal would not be done in a
timely fashion anymore.  In July 2006, the [slow burial of the Hurd
Wiki](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2006-07/msg00014.html) was
announced.

## Rev. II

Considering this [from April 2006 on
already](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/web-hurd/2006-04/msg00000.html), on
2007-08-12 the conversion of the TWiki content to a format usable by
[ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info) was finally finished.  Read
[[about_the_twiki_to_ikiwiki_conversion]].

This wiki instance is now running distributed over two GNU/Hurd machines, and
is also providing the content of the official GNU Hurd pages.
