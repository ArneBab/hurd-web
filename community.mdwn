There is an expanding community of people developing and running test Debian
GNU/Hurd machines.

The **two key resources** most often used for communication are the Debian and GNU
[[mailing_lists]], as well as the [[IRC]].

If you're interested in current events and discussion, you can join the [bug hurd](http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-hurd) list, or have a look at its archives.
