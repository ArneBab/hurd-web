There is an expanding community of people developing and running test Debian
GNU/Hurd machines.

The two key resources most often used for communication are the Debian and GNU
[[mailinglists]], as well as the [[IRC]].

[[community/Meetings]] -- Meetings with Hurd developer attendance.

[[Hurd/WhoRunsGNU]]

[[Hurd/HurdDevelopers]] -- Who's who?

[Hurd User's Guide](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/users-guide/using_gnuhurd.html).
