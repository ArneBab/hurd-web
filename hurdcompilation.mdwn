I checked out the source code on my Ubuntu GNU/Linux system connected to the
Internet using:

    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/hurd co hurd

I mounted the hurd directory on Ubuntu from my GNU Hurd system connected to the
LAN through NFS:

    settrans -ac /mnt /hurd/nfs ubuntu:/home/shaks/code

Copy the hurd directory, locally.

For compilation, you require build-essential, libc0.3-dev, hurd-dev.  I used
Debian GNU Hurd K10 CDs for installation and they are available in the first
CD.

    apt-get update
    apt-get install build-essential libc0.3-dev hurd-dev

Enter into the hurd directory and start building it:

    cd hurd
    mkdir build 
    cd build 
    ../configure
    make

There is a "libiohelp needed by" error.  So, do a manual compilation for
libiohelp.

    cd ..
    make libiohelp
    cd build
    make

There is a "libiostore needed by" error.  So, do a manual compilation for
libiostore.

    cd ..
    make libiostore
    cd build
    make

There is a "libiohelp.so: No such file or directory" error.

Copy libiohelp/libiohelp.so file to build/libiohelp/ and re-run make,

    make

The executables are created in the subdirectories in build/ directory.
