OK, here'a a place to discuss the Hurd community email lists.

_Problem:_

Right now serious discussions are held via email. There are several email lists as demonstrated in [[Hurd/MailLists]]. This keeps some folks from bothering to use the Hurd wiki.

_Solution:_

Integrate email better with hurd.gnufans.org. There are lots of ways this is possible. For now I plan to brainstorm in this topic.

I have already collected some links to topics about this at TWiki:Main/GrantBow.

_Result:_

Quicker adoption within the Hurd Community. Secondary benefit is that TWiki is weak in this area.
