The [[GnuSkin]] is a rip-off from the [[TigerSkin]] with a lot of the flashy stuff removed. It is designed to be simple and functional and yet stylish enough to be used in production like environments.

The [[GnuSkin]] design is a rip-off the Hurd website, mainly with a few bells and whistles from TWiki added. The author is yours truly with a lot of help from the community at large.

See the [[GnuSkinPlugin]] page for more information on the [[GnuSkin]] features.
