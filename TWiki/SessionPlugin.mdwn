This Plugin allows session information to be retained whilst a browser is running. It does this by storing a small session cookie in the browser. This contains an identification string that TWiki uses to extract session information on the server.

Notes:

* The cookie is not persistant

* The session information is stored in files under `data/.sessions/`

* Old session files should be deleted by a cron job

* The identification string used for a session is:

* * time (second resolution) + random number

* If url parameter `stickskin` is present, its value sets the session value for `SKIN` i.e. you then stick on this skin. Get back to defalt skin with _stickskin=._

* Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Holds session information on server, session identified from sessionId stored in non-persistant cookie

* Set DEBUG = 1
