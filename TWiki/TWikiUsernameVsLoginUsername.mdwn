This section only applies to you in case the server where %WIKITOOLNAME% is installed is authenticated and on an Intranet.

%WIKITOOLNAME% manages internally two usernames: Login username and Wiki username.

* **Login username:** When you login to the Intranet you use your login username, i.e. `pthoeny`. This name is passed to %WIKITOOLNAME% by the `REMOTE_USER` environment variable. %WIKITOOLNAME% uses this name internally to log topic changes. Login usernames are maintained by your system administrator.
* **Wiki username:** Is your name in [[WikiNotation]], i.e. `PeterThoeny`. Your [[WikiName]] will be created when you register in [[TWikiRegistration]]; doing so will also create your personal home page.

**Note:** When you refer to a [[WikiName]] of a user (your own or somebody else's) be sure to specify the %MAINWEB% web in front of the Wiki username, e.g. write <code>%MAINWEB%.WikiUsername</code> or <code>%MAINWEB%.WikiUsername</code>. This assures that the name will be linked automatically to the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, even if the text is written in a different %WIKITOOLNAME% web.

%WIKITOOLNAME% can map the Intranet username to the Wiki username automatically, provided that the Login username and Wiki username pair has been entered in the %MAINWEB%.TWikiUsers topic. This happens automatically when you register.
