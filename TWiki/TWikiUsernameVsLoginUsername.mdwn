TWiki manages internally two usernames: Login username and Wiki username.

* **Login username:** When you login to the Intranet you use your login username, e.g. `pthoeny`. TWiki uses this name internally to log who changed topics.
* **Wiki username:** Is your name in [[WikiNotation]], e.g. `PeterThoeny`. When you register in [[TWikiRegistration]] your [[WikiName]] will be created along with your personal home page.

**Note:** When you refer to a [[WikiName]] of a user (your own or somebody else's) be sure to specify the Main web in front of the Wiki user name, e.g. write it as Main.WikiUsername. This assures that the name will be linked automatically to the TWiki.Main web, even if the text is written in a different Wiki web.

TWiki can map the Intranet username to the Wiki username automatically, provided that the Login username and Wiki username pair has been entered in the %MAINWEB%.TWikiUsers topic. This happens automatically when you register.
