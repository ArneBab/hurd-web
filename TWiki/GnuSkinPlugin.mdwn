This is the [[TWiki/GnuSkin]] plugin. It's designed to more like a general [GNU](http://www.gnu.org) web page and less like the [[TWiki/TigerSkinPlugin]].

Lean &amp; simple and yet still good looking and stylish.

* Description
  * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = A complete bare bones skin theme template for TWiki

* Debug plugin? Output can be viewed in data/debug.txt
  * Set DEBUG = 0

The [[GnuSkin]] makes use of most the [[WebMenu]] concept, first introduced by the [[TigerSkin]].

Status: I should say at least alpha quality but the jump from alpha to beta is not far away. Frankly, it's mostly a lot of cleaning up to do.

Download: Send me an email if you want a snapshot.
