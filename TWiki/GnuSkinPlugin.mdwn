This is the [[TWiki/GnuSkin]] plugin. It's designed to more like a general [GNU](http://www.gnu.org) web page and less like the [[TWiki/TigerSkinPlugin]].

Lean &amp; simple and yet still good looking and stylish.

* Description
  * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = A complete bare bones skin theme template for TWiki

* Debug plugin? Output can be viewed in data/debug.txt
  * Set DEBUG = 0

The [[GnuSkin]] makes use of most the [[WebMenu]] concept, first introduced by the [[TigerSkin]]. See it in action on the [[Know/WebHome]].

Status: It's at beta stage. Now I only have to start ripping out allt the pieces that still say [[TigerSkin]] and are redundant before I start distributing this.

Download: Send me an email if you want a snapshot.
