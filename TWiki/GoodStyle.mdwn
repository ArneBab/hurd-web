* TWiki has very simple **[[TextFormattingRules]]**. You won't go wrong if you:
  * start each line without spaces
  * separate paragraphs with a blank line

* Run together capitalized words to make **[[WikiWords]]:**
  * [[WikiWords]] automatically appear as hyperlinks
  * make up meaningful Wiki names - it can be a challenge (it'll sharpen you up!)
  * [[WikiWords]] has name-creation tips that may help

* If a **discussion** is going on on a [[WikiTopic]]:
  * separate each follow up with a horizontal rule
  * add your [[WikiName]] and date at the end

* A good format for a **new topic** is "dissertation followed by discussion":
  * start with a brief, factual introduction
  * then bring on the opinions.

* When a discussion dies down and the page becomes static, feel free to **refactor mercilessly**:
  * fearlessly edit down to capture the key points
  * reduce the noise without losing the facts or the flavor
  * if you merge or delete comments, you can group list "Contributors:" at the end of the page
  * That's how Wiki content matures and grows in value over time.

* For **external site links**, you can type URLs directly into the text - <code>**http://etcete.ra/...**</code> - it'll clear to anyone where they're headed on click.

* TWiki is international, and an international standard **date format** like 01 Sep 2001 is preferred. A date like 9/1/01, can mean either January or September, depending on the local conventions of the readers. For months, use the first three letters: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr,...

* Look at the source when you want to find out how something is formatted: click **More** on the lower toolbar, then checkmark **Raw text format** and click on **[ View revision ]**. A bit of HTML experience can't hurt, but you'll soon see with TWiki how far that is from necessary.
