* TWiki has a very simple **[[TWikiShorthand]]**. In any case, you won't go wrong if you simply:
  * start each line without spaces
  * separate paragraphs with a blank line

* Run together capitalized words to form **[[WikiWords]]:**
  * [[WikiWords]] automatically appear as hyperlinks
  * make up meaningful, reasonably brief Wiki names - it can be a challenge (it'll sharpen you up!)
  * [[WikiWords]] has name-creation tips that may help

* If a **discussion** is going on:
  * separate each follow-up with a space
  * add your [[WikiName]] and the date at the end
  * OR, by all means, insert your comment where it seems to fit best:
    * you may want to insert it with a bullet and/or _set it in italics_ so it's clear (always sign and date)
  * if a sub-topic develops, separate it with a horizontal rule at beginning and end

* A good format for a **new topic** is "dissertation followed by discussion":
  * start with a brief, factual introduction, followed by double horizontal rules
  * let the discussion begin

* When a discussion dies down and the page becomes static, if you're clear on your course, feel free to **refactor mercilessly**:
  * fearlessly edit down to capture the key points
  * reduce the noise without losing the facts or the flavor
  * if you merge or delete comments, group credit `Contributors:` at the end of the page
  * _This is how Wiki content matures and grows in value over time._

* For **external site links**, you can type URLs directly into the text - `http://etcete.ra/...` - it'll clear to anyone where they're headed on click.

* TWiki is intended for world-wide use, and an international **standard date format** like 01 Sep 2001 is preferred. It's universally understood, and clearer than the xx/xx/xx format, where a date like 9/1/01 can mean either Jan or Sep, depending on the local conventions of the readers. For months, use the first three letters: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr,...

* **TIP:** Check the source when you want to find out how something is formatted: click <code>**Edit**</code> on the lower toolbar. To see earlier versions, click <code>**More**</code>, then check <code>**Raw text format**</code> and click <code>**View revision**</code>. A bit of HTML experience can't hurt, but you'll soon see with [[TWikiShorthand]] how far that is from necessary.
