# <a name="TWiki_Meta_Discussion"> TWiki Meta Discussion </a>

Removed old stale discussion ([[WIKIHOMEURLTWikiTWikiDiscussrev12]]).

The WebMenu stuff has been fixed. We only have one menu now, the TWiki.WebMenu topic. Old per-web WebMenus have been moved to the Trash.

**_Suggestion #1:_**

How about always expanding the TWiki and Main webs' items? They only contain

* [[Main/TWikiUsers]] &amp; [[Main/TWikiGroups]]
* [[WelcomeGuest]], [[TWikiRegistration]] &amp; [[WikiSyntax]] topics.

I think it could be useful to have those topics listed all the time. (The [[Main/TWikiGroups]] could of course be removed)

**_Suggestion #2:_**

What about the [[WebNotify]] topic and other useful tools, why not include the most useful ones in the menu as well?
