# <a name="TWiki_Meta_Discussion"> TWiki Meta Discussion </a>

Didn't this web used to be a different color? I like how the colors of the [[Main/WebHome]] and [[TWiki/WebHome]] webs are the same, implying to me that they are "administrative overhead" and do not contain content intended for end users as content.

It still is in the same orange:ish/skin-colored color that it has always been. The Main web is still "screaming" bright YELLOW.

We need to track down why you see this - so I can replicate the problem and hopefully also FIX it!

So Joachim, despite the Main web being the kind of "home" right now with the python script running it becomes more of a marketing type page rather than a TWiki description and home page. They seem like different functions to me.

Hmmm, I don't think I understand then what it is you're after.

I thought the HTML front page was supposed to be an introduction to the Hurd wiki, explaning a bit about what a wiki is. My idea was that the HTML front page gives a presentation and then the user selects "continue" and is then presnted the same page - but in Wiki format. That way the user still recognizes the content and is perhaps not as intimidated by the Wiki stuff.

It was just a very limited idea - show me what it was You wanted!

Whereas we crammed all the meta discussion into the bottom of the Hurd web I think we should move the discussions that are related to the entire TWiki install to topics in the TWiki or Main webs. Does that make sense?

Given the Python script I don't think the [[Main/WebHome]] is the right place for them. I don't like having that discussion directly on the [[TWiki/WebHome]] since it's supposed to be about TWiki primarily. So where should we move the meta-discussion and topic index to? Maybe right here, [[TWiki/TWikiDiscuss]] would be appropriate?

I hope you like the \_webname\_Discuss format I chose to talking about the setup of each web. I think that makes some sense.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 15 Nov 2002

The meta discussions are great to place in a \_webname\_Discuss topic - very good idea! I'm trying to get used to working on the Hurd wiki using **many** webs -- it is going to take me a while to wrap my head around what that actually means.

Oh, I also redid custom non-default [[WebMenu]] topics for each web to give the navigation model that I feel is so important. Each one having it's details pop up as it's selected but maintaining spacial relationships between the web names. If you know of some way to do all of that automatically instead of with custom topics each that would be fine but I didn't know how to do that so I did it perhaps the hard way.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 15 Nov 2002

If I understand you correctly we can do this with only one WebMenu, the TWiki.WebMenu.

By default the menu for each web will expand automatically when that web is selected. I.e., the items for the Hurd web will not be seen in the Mach web, and vice versa.

I can redo the Perl engine so that the URL "Edit Menu" always points to the TWiki.WebMenu from all webs, that isn't too much work.
