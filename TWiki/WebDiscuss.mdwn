# <a name="TWiki_Meta_Discussion"> TWiki Meta Discussion </a>

Removed old stale discussion ([[WIKIHOMEURLTWikiWebDiscussrev12]]).

The WebMenu stuff has been fixed. We only have one menu now, the TWiki.WebMenu topic. Old per-web WebMenus have been moved to the Trash.

**_Suggestion #1:_**

How about always expanding the TWiki and Main webs' items? They only contain

* [[Main/TWikiUsers]] &amp; [[Main/TWikiGroups]]
* [[WelcomeGuest]], [[TWikiRegistration]] &amp; [[WikiSyntax]] topics.

I think it could be useful to have those topics listed all the time. (The [[Main/TWikiGroups]] could of course be removed)

**_Suggestion #2:_**

What about the [[WebNotify]] topic and other useful tools, why not include the most useful ones in the menu as well?

I've added tables to alll but the Main [[WebHome]] pages to address some of this. Having some always expanded may be good but I feel the sense of navigation one gets when clicking between them is important. With the new changes I'll be looking to modify the TWiki.WebMenu topic now to provide just such a feature.

That sounds OK with me. Don't hesitate to ask if you don't get how the webmenu works.

Do you have a date in mind where you want to declare the migration period over? I am tentatively targeting Jan 1, 2003 as my target date to move everything I want to move out of the Hurd Web.

What a revolutionary, setting at date for an open source/free software project! :-)

Good, Jan 1st it is then. I'll try to fit some of my time into the wiki as well.

Wow, I added the little table and statistics box with search. I didn't realize that so many people were interested in the Skin changing topic in this web.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 22 Dec 2002

I think that's mainly because the skin icon on the top menu uses the [[SkinSelec]] topic for its main business.
