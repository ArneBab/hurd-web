Do you have a date in mind where you want to declare the migration period over? I am tentatively targeting Jan 1, 2003 as my target date to move everything I want to move out of the Hurd Web.

What a revolutionary, setting at date for an open source/free software project! :-)

Good, Jan 1st it is then. I'll try to fit some of my time into the wiki as well.

Wow, I added the little table and statistics box with search. I didn't realize that so many people were interested in the Skin changing topic in this web.

I think that's mainly because the skin icon on the top menu uses the [[SkinSelect]] topic for its main business.
