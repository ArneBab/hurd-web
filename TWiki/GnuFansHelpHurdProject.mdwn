I was discussing the current community situation with a few choice people. We agreed that the Hurd project runs on alot of email. It's the primary method. This is good for interactivity, but not good for knowledge management - even if an email has a URL we can point to in the archive it's of limited use since you can't append to it. It's relatively fleeting feedback and very static.

In theory this site can provide a supplement for those seeking help with the Hurd. A functional if not very clearly organized example exists on the TWiki:Support web.

There have also been discussions about Email integration with Hurd in different ways. We have a unique situation in that the mail list and archives already exist.

This topic is for discussion about what might be possible to provide for the benefit of the Hurd community.
