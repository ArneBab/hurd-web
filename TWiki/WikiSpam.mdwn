There has been an awful lot of spam on the Hurd Wiki the past six months. After having dealt with this manually the maintainer wrote a script to revert affected pages and delete bogus users. Still, this took up too much time and the result is that the site is closed for automatic registration.

This also affects old accounts in that they cannot use the [[ChangePassword]] page anymore, instead all passwords to be set or changed must go via [[ResetPassword]] and be mailed to yours truly.

I am sorry for any inconvenice this may cause but the situation had simply become unmanageable.

We put much work into this site, but without active participation the bit rot continues and the value decreases. I wish I had more time and desire to help, but frankly the lack of interest of the Hurd community in this site wasn't encouraging me to spend my time on it.
