There has been an awful lot of spam on the Hurd Wiki the past six months. After having dealt with this manually the maintainer wrote a script to revert affected pages and delete bogus users. Still, this took up too much time and the result is that the site is closed for automatic registration.

This also affects old accounts in that they cannot use the [[ChangePassword]] page anymore, instead all passwords to be set or changed must go via [[ResetPassword]] and be mailed to yours truly.

I am sorry for any inconvenice this may cause but the situation had simply become unmanageable.
