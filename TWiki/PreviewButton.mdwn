It used to be on this Wiki and is found on many other Wikis.

_In fact this wiki used to have **only** preview button IIRC. You had to preview and save from preview page which could be annoing for frequent users._

## <a name="Answer_"> Answer: </a>

The preview process has been redone in the [[GnuSkin]] due to popular request from other site users. This [[GnuSkin]] installation is just like any other and so the change also affects it.

In the future it might be possible to have different levels of configuration of the [[GnuSkin]], even on user level. However, that is so far into the future it might not be the present author who takes it on. I might alter things in the next major release of the [[GnuSkin]] - plans are to integrate the preview and save page so that one could preview **OR** save directly.

In the case there are users who don't like this and want the preview back the only possible solution is to change to another skin. Vmlinux.org has the [[SessionPlugin]] installed and thus the user can simply click on the "Skin" link in the top right corner. Available right now is the default TWiki skin and the Tiger skin (also in its blue theme).

**_Back to:_** [[TWikiFAQ]]

Ok, it should not be in this FAQ if it has no answer, but I wonder how it is removed.
