Welcome,

you have reached the TWiki web (pronounced twee-kee web). TWiki is a meeting place to collaborate on common interests. Everybody can contribute by just using a web browser. It looks like a normal web site, but then... everybody can edit web pages.

**Main Features of TWiki**

* Edit existing pages or create new pages by using any web browser.
* Web pages are automatically linked. You do not need to learn HTML commands to link pages.
* Very simple text formatting. Basically you write a web page like you would write an email.
* Full text search with/without regular expressions.
* All changes to pages are under revision control. Find out who changed what and when.
* Automatic email notification when web pages change.
* File attachments: Upload and download any file as an attachment to a page by using your browser. This is similar to email file attachments, but it happens on web pages.
* Topic locking: Users are warned if a page is being edited by an other person. This is to prevent contention, e.g. simultaneous page editing.

**How TWiki Works**

TWiki is divided up into **webs** , each one represents one area of collaboration. Currently we have three TWiki webs:

* [TWiki.Main](%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/Main): The web you are currently in. It is the entry point, has a list of all [[TWikiUsers]] and offices.
* [TWiki.Know](%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/Know): Knowledge Base area. This is to demonstrate how to use TWiki as a knowledge base for support.
* [TWiki.Test](%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/Test): Just for testing.

Each web has hyper-linked topics. A **topic** is one web page in your browser.

To browse this Wiki site, just click on any highlighted link. These links are called [[WikiWords]], and comprise two or more words with initial capitals, run together.

To edit any page, click on "Edit" at the bottom of the page. You can edit the page from within your browser, using [[WikiSyntax]], a very simple markup language. You could also use HTML if you wish, but his is optional. (Before you can edit pages you need to register in [[TWikiRegistration]].)

A highlighted "?" following a [[WikiTopic]] means that no content has yet been entered for that topic. You are invited to add some content by clicking on the "?". You are encouraged to include [[WikiWords]] in your content, for others to fill out later.

Please follow the [[TWikiTutorial]] to get you up to speed on TWiki.
