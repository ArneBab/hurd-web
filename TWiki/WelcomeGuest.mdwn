Welcome,

you have reached the TWiki web (pronounced twee-kee web). TWiki is a meeting place to collaborate on common interests. Everybody can contribute by just using a web browser. It looks like a normal web site, but then... everybody can edit web pages.

TWiki is divided up into **webs** , each one represents one area of collaboration. This Twiki installation has two TWiki webs:

* [TWiki.Main](%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/Main): Entry point, has the list of TWiki guests, also used for explanations and testing.
* [TWiki.Know](%SCRIPTURLPATH%/view%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/Know): Knowledge Base area. This is to demonstrate how to use TWiki as a knowledge base for support.

Each web has topics. A **topic** is one web page in your browser. You can edit a topic by clicking on the **Edit** link at the bottom of each page.

Good starting points in the TWiki.Main web are:

* [[WebHome]]: Entry point of this TWiki web.
* [[TWikiWeb]]: Explains what a TWiki web is.
* [[GoodStyle]]: Things to consider when changing text.
* [[TextFormattingRules]]: Easy to learn rules when editing text.
* [Changes](%SCRIPTURLPATH%/changes%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/Main): Recent changes to the TWiki.Main web.
* [[TestArea]]: The place where you can get your virtual hands dirty.
* [[TWikiUsers]]: List of users.
* [[TWikiRegistration]]: **Before you leave** add your name here.
