**FAQ:**

I've problems with the WebSearch. There is no Search Result on any inquiry. By clicking the Index topic it's the same problem.

**Answer:**

That is an indication that %WIKITOOLNAME% can't find the `egrep` and `fgrep` commands on your system. Check the `$egrepCmd` and `$fgrepCmd` variables in `twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm`.

See other [[TWikiFAQs]].
