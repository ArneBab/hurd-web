Each %WIKITOOLNAME% web does an automatic email notification of recent changes. Users can subscribe / unsubscribe themselves in %NOTIFYTOPIC% of each TWiki web. The Perl script `mailnotify` is called by a deamon in regular intervals. The script is sending an automated email to subscribed users in case some topics changed in a web within this interval.

Implementation note: Edit the cron table so that `mailnotify` is called in an interval of your choice. Please consult `man crontab` of how to modify the table that schedules program execution at certain intervals. Example:

    % crontab -e
    15,45 * * * * (cd ~twiki/public_html/bin; ./mailnotify)

The above line will call mailnotify at 15 minutes and 45 minutes passed every hour.
