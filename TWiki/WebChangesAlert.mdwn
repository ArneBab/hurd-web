## <a name="Web_Changes_Notification_Service"> Web Changes Notification Service </a>

Each TWiki web has an automatic email notification service that sends you an email with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert.

* You can subscribe and unsubscribe yourself in [[WebNotify]] on each web. Changes are immediate.

* The frequency of alerts is set by the TWiki site administrator: it could be once a day, every hour, whatever works for the particular web.
  * On TWiki.org, [[WebChangesAlerts]] are sent once a day.
