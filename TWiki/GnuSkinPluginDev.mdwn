The [[GnuSkinPluginDev]] provides a public forum for discussion regarding the [[GnuSkin]] and its plugin.

**_Primary goals include:_**

Issues the current release, v1.0, will address.

* Basic skin compatible with most browsers: Mozilla 4.xx-6.xx, Lynx, W3M, Links, (X)Emacs/W3 and maybe even Internet Explorer.
* Looks, "skin deep" design ï¿½ la [The Hurd](http://hurd.gnu.org) web pages.
* User configurable everything, as far as possible. Therefore the TigerSkin's WebMenu parser is integrated.

**_Secondary goals:_**

These design goals will go into the v2.0 series of the Gnuskin.

* Quicker.
* Lesser files.
* Smaller.
* Extended configurability - Edit **all** of the webmenu, change topmenu, etc.
