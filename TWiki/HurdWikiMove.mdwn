Many thanks to [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] for his work to establish and help update this Hurd Twiki site! You have been extremely kind with your efforts in creating the new GNU skin and all of the expected and unexpected administrative work that's been needed since establishing this Twiki installation.

Now that the site is established, the traffic levels are growing and the value of the site is evident, the Hurd project usage must not overstay our welcome. In the coming months in order to continue hosting the Hurd Twiki we need to look for both:

* a new ISP connection

* new hardware (hopefully running the Hurd!)

Please add your comments here or email webmaster at vmlinux dot org.

Potential places to move Hurd Twiki to in order of preference:

* other
* savannah.gnu.org
* gnu.org

I favor removing gnu.org from the above list. There are copyright issues that are technically impossible to address in the way that RMS wants copyright assigned to all content hosted on gnu.org. While we probably could bend over backwards to accomodate it, fundamentally I think that this and other potential problems are not worth the effort of making this Hurd Twiki an official part of the GNU project.

Technically I think that savannah.gnu.org might be possible but I will defer to others for a decision from this perspective. Assuming it's possible, I think we may have similar problems as above.

I favor looking for another solution, an "other".
