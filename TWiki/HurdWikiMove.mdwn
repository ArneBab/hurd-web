Many thanks to [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] for his work to establish and help update this Hurd Twiki site! You have been extremely kind with your efforts in creating the new GNU skin and all of the expected and unexpected administrative work that's been needed since establishing this Twiki installation.

Now that the site is established, the traffic levels are growing and the value of the site is evident, the Hurd project usage must not overstay our welcome. In the coming months in order to continue hosting the Hurd Twiki we need to look for both:

* a new ISP connection

* new hardware (hopefully running the Hurd!)

Please email webmaster at vmlinux dot org with comments and suggestions or edit [[HurdTwikiMoveComments]].
