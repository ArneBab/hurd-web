_Adding, renaming and deleting webs are manual operations done directly on the server_

## <a name="Overview"> Overview </a>

Managing TWiki webs requires direct access to the installation files on the host server. There are currently no browser-based equivalents of the Rename/move/delete topic tools for working with webs.

## <a name="Adding_a_New_Web"> Adding a New Web </a>

Adding new webs is quick and easy - you can have a basic web up and running in a couple of minutes:

1. **Create** a new directory under `twiki/data/`, ex: `twiki/data/Newweb`<br />
  * the name has to start with a capital and _cannot_ be a [[WikiWord]]
2. **Copy** in the contents of `twiki/data/_default`.

For detailed instructions, see [[TWikiDocumentation]].

## <a name="Renaming_or_Deleting_a_Web"> Renaming or Deleting a Web </a>

**NOTE:** If you plan to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, remember that TWiki stores user and group topics in <code>%MAINWEB%</code>, default named `Main`. That means, every [[WikiName]] signature - <code>Main.SomeUserName</code> - points to it and would need updating (unless the variable, <code>%MAINWEB%.SomeUserName</code>, is used throughout).

1. Prepare your site: Search each web for links to the target web, searching topic text for `Oldwebname.`, including the dot so you'll find references like `Oldwebname.SomeTopic`.
  * Make changes as required, to `Newwebname.SomeTopic` or better yet, to <code>=%MAINWEB%.SomeTopic</code>.
2. Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic: Rename or delete the web from the `WIKIWEBLIST` variable.
3. Edit the [[TWikiWebsTable]] topic: Rename or delete the web from the table.
4. Login to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server, via Telnet or FTP.
5. Go to `twiki/data` and rename or remove the web directory.
6. Go to `twiki/templates` and rename or remove the web directory if present.
7. Go to `twiki/pub` and rename or remove the web directory if present.
