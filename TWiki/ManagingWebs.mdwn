To work with entire TWiki webs, you need direct access to the installation files on the host server. Connecting by Telnet or FTP is the usual approach. Before making changes to a web, you can move individual topics through your browser (see [[TWiki/RenameTopic]]). No similar web controls are available through the browser interface.

* **NOTE:** Think twice if you intend to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, since many files point to it. If you do rename it, you'll also have to change all occurrences of `Main` to the new web name - this includes, for example, the user signatures across your entire TWiki site. (On the other hand, if the variable <code>**%MAINWEB%**</code> is used throughout, you have no problem.)

1. **Prepare your site:** Other webs may link to the web you want to rename or delete. Search each web for links to the target web: search all webs for `Abouttochange.` - include the period to find topics like `Abouttochange.SomeTopic`. Make changes as required.
2. **Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic:** Rename or delete the web from the `WIKIWEBLIST` variable.
3. **Edit the [[TWikiWebsTable]] topic:** Rename or delete the web from the table.
4. **Connect to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server:** Login via Telnet or FTP.
5. **Edit the data files:** Go to <code>**twiki/data**</code> and rename or delete the web directory.
6. **Edit the template files:** Go to <code>**twiki/templates**</code> and rename or delete the web directory if present.
7. **Edit the public files:** Go to <code>**twiki/pub**</code> and rename or delete the web directory if present.
