The current implementation of %WIKITOOLNAME% is designed to never forget, that means all topic changes are under revision control and you can't delete or rename topics.

Nevertheless there are cases where you wish to delete topics. %WIKITOOLNAME% requires administrative stuff like that to be done on the shell level, so please ask your %WIKITOOLNAME% administrator to do that for you. A future version will allow administrators to do that on the browser level.

**How to Rename or Delete a Topic**

* Go to the topic you want to rename / delete.
* Find out the back-links to this page from _Ref-By_ . Modify other topics if needed.
* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
* cd to `twiki/data` and then to the web where the topic is located. Rename / delete the topic ( `name.txt` ) and repository file ( `name.txt,v` ). **_Hint:_** Instead of deleting a topic you could create a `Trash` web and move topics/repositories to this web. (A future version of TWiki might have a Trash web.)
* Edit the `.changes` file and rename / delete all occurrences of the topic. **_Note:_** There might be several lines of the topic.
* cd to `twiki/pub` and then to the web where the topic is located. Rename / delete the topic attachment directory if present.

**How to add a New Web**

* See [[TWikiInstallationNotes]].

**How to Rename or Delete a Web**

* It is advisable not to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web.
* Be aware that other webs might link to the web you want to rename / delete. Search each web for links to this web, i.e. search all webs for `Obsolete.` (include the period, this is to find topics like `Obsolete.SomeTopic` ). Take measures if necessary.
* Edit the [[TWikiPreferences]] topic and rename / delete the web from the `WIKIWEBLIST` variable.
* Edit the [[TWikiWebsTable]] topic and rename / delete the web from the table.
* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
* cd to `twiki/data` and rename / delete the web directory.
* cd to `twiki/templates` and rename / delete the web directory if present.
* cd to `twiki/pub` and rename / delete the web directory if present.
