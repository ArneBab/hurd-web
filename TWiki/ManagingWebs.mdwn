_Adding, renaming and deleting webs is done directly on the server_

## <a name="Overview"> Overview </a>

Managing TWiki webs requires direct access to the installation files on the host server. There are no browser-based web tools.

## <a name="How_to_Add_a_New_Web"> How to Add a New Web </a>

Adding new webs is quick and easy - you can have a basic web up and running in a couple of minutes:

1. **Create** a new directory under <code>**twiki/data/**</code>, ex: `twiki/data/newweb`
2. **Copy** in the contents of `twiki/data/_default`.

For detailed instructions: [[TWikiDocumentation]].

## <a name="How_to_Rename_or_Delete_a_Web"> How to Rename or Delete a Web </a>

**NOTE:** Think twice if you intend to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, since many files point to it. If you rename it, you also have to change all occurrences of `Main` to the new web name (like the web prefixes for all user signatures, <code>Main.SomeName</code>). (On the other hand, if the <code>%MAINWEB%</code> variable is used throughout, you won't have that problem.)

1. Prepare your site: Other webs may link to the web you want to rename or delete. Search each web for links to the target web: search all webs for `Abouttochange.` - include the period to find topics like `Abouttochange.SomeTopic`. Make changes as required.
2. Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic: Rename or delete the web from the `WIKIWEBLIST` variable.
3. Edit the [[TWikiWebsTable]] topic: Rename or delete the web from the table.
4. Connect to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server: Login via Telnet or FTP.
5. Edit the data files: Go to `twiki/data` and rename or delete the web directory.
6. Edit the template files: Go to `twiki/templates` and rename or delete the web directory if present.
7. Edit the public files: Go to `twiki/pub` and rename or delete the web directory if present.
