The current implementation of %WIKITOOLNAME% is designed to never forget. So you can't delete a topic, however you can move or rename a topic and the original information is saved in topic meta data. If you want an even stronger memory, you can disable renaming on some or all topics; see [[TWikiAccessControl]].

* It is advisable not to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web.
* Be aware that other webs might link to the web you want to rename / delete. Search each web for links to this web, i.e. search all webs for `Obsolete.` (include the period, this is to find topics like `Obsolete.SomeTopic` ). Take measures if necessary.
* Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic and rename / delete the web from the `WIKIWEBLIST` variable.
* Edit the [[TWikiWebsTable]] topic and rename / delete the web from the table.
* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
* cd to <code>**twiki/data**</code> and rename / delete the web directory.
* cd to <code>**twiki/templates**</code> and rename / delete the web directory if present.
* cd to <code>**twiki/pub**</code> and rename / delete the web directory if present.
