So what is this WikiWiki thing exactly?

## <a name="Answer_"> Answer: </a>

A set of pages of information that are open and free for anyone to edit as they wish. They are stored on a server and managed using some Perl CGI scripts. The system creates cross-reference hyperlinks between pages automatically. See [[WelcomeGuest]] and [[TWikiSite]] for more information.
