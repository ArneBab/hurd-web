**FAQ:**

So what is this WikiWiki thing exactly?

**Answer:**

A set of pages of information that are open and free for anyone to edit as they wish. They are stored on a server and managed using some Perl CGI scripts. The system creates cross-reference hyperlinks between pages automatically. See [[WelcomeGuest]] and [[TWikiWeb]] for more information.
