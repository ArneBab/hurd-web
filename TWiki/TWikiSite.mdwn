* A TWiki site is an easy-to-use, satisfying open communication environment where...

TWiki's parsing engine reads a text file, hyperlinks it, and converts it to standard HTML, on the fly. The point is to:

* make editing text extremely simple (to see how simple, click on **Edit** link at the bottom of the page)
* and to let you find information fast ([[WebSearch]]).

In addition to being quick, %WIKITOOLNAME% aspires to the Zen ideals known as [[WabiSabi]]. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.

%WIKITOOLNAME% is one of many [[WikiWikiClones]]; the first Wiki was built by Wiki:WardCummingham, <http://c2.com/>.
