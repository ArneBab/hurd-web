The %WIKITOOLNAME% web is a web-based collaboration tool.

* [[WelcomeGuest]] tells you more about how to use it.
* TWiki's home is at <http://TWiki.org/>

%WIKITOOLNAME% is a cgi-bin script written in Perl. It reads a text file, hyperlinks it and converts it to HTML on the fly. The point is to:

* make the text editing process very simple ( click on the **Edit** link at the bottom of the page )
* and to find information fast ( [[WebSearch]] ).

What does the name TWiki stand for?

* _Wiki wiki_ means quick in Hawai'ian. They call the shuttle at the Honolulu airport the [ wiki wiki bus](http://www.quickaid.com/airports/hnl/company/trans_tm.html).
* _TWiki_ is the short form of _TakeFive Wiki_ . (Later on I found out that _Twiki_ is the name of a robot in a [Buck Rogers](http://www.buck-rogers.com/) TV show in 1979)

%WIKITOOLNAME% is one of many [[WikiWikiClones]]; the first one was built by Ward Cummingham.
