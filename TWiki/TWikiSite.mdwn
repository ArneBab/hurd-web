## <a name="TWiki_is_a_Web_based_collaborati"> TWiki is a Web-based collaboration tool </a>

* A TWiki site is a simple, satisfying, full-featured open communication environment:
  * people anywhere online can meet
  * rich Web text, images, online multimedia are easily shared
  * documents and other files can be uploaded and downloaded
  * everything works through a regular Web browser

### <a name="TWiki_is_written_in_Perl_"> TWiki is written in Perl... </a>

* TWiki's parsing engine reads a text file, hyperlinks it, and converts TWiki shorthand into standard HTML, on the fly. The point is to:
  * make editing text extremely simple (to see how simple, click on the **Edit** link at the bottom of the page)
  * let you find information fast ([[WebSearch]]).

* In addition to being quick, as a meeting and colloboration space, %WIKITOOLNAME% aspires to the Zen ideals known as [[WabiSabi]]. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.

* %WIKITOOLNAME% is one of many [[WikiWikiClones]], based on the original [Wiki Wiki Web](http://c2.com/), built by Wiki:WardCummingham.

### <a name="_TWiki_stands_for_"> "TWiki" stands for... </a>
