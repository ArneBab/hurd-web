%TOC%

Each page in a TWiki web is called a **_topic_**, defined by its meaningful, descriptive %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord title.

## <a name="Page_Features"> Page Features </a>

A TWiki topic is a self-contained information unit, rich in features that include:

* a [[WikiWord]] title that lets you:
  * instantly identify what the page is about
  * autolink to it from other pages simply by typing it in
* an edit-anywhere collaboration area where you can:
  * enter plain or HTML-formatted text
  * work with simple [[TWikiShorthand]] (the power of HTML plus special TWiki tags)
  * include links, images, anything else you can put on a regular Web page
* an optional [[TWikiDocumentation]] feature to:
  * store structured info along with the freeform page content
  * use text fields and boxes, radio buttons, pulldown selector menus, checkboxes
  * select the right input template for each page from a choice of multiple form
* a [[FileAttachment]] function that allows you to:
  * upload files through your browser to the TWiki server
  * attach any size and type of file (documents, images, applications) for viewing or downloading
  * make changes and update existing files
* [[TWikiDocumentation]] that work on the web level, but can also be used to customize the look of headers and footers on a single page
* browser-based controls for renaming, moving, and deleting pages:
  * rename a page and automatically update all the links referring to it, site-wide
  * move a page from one TWiki web to another
  * safely delete a topic to a special Trash web (invisible, but accessible to the TWiki administrators if needed)
* flexible [[TWikiDocumentation]]:
  * independently determine who can view, edit, rename, move or delete topics
  * set permissions by individual users and user groups

The configuration of your TWiki site and your own user account determine which of these features you can use.

## <a name="How_to_rename_move_or_delete_a_p"> How to rename, move or delete a page </a>

You can now rename, move and delete individual topics from your browser. All three options are available by clicking **More** on the control strip at the bottom of every page. Access to one or more of these three options, for a topic, a web or an entire site, may be available to administrators only. In any case, all three are similar and extremely self-explanatory.

1. On the page you want to change, click **More** &gt; **Rename/move**
2. To move or delete: select the target web (`Trash` for delete)from the pull-down menu; otherwise, leave on the current web
3. To rename: fill in a new [[WikiName]] (otherwise, leave the current topic name)
4. To update occurrences of the topic name on other pages: From the list of pages that link to the topic, check or uncheck each entry as you desire - only checked links will be updated;
5. Click **Rename/move**: the topic will be renamed and links to the topic updated.
  * Any problems are listed; you can change them later.
  * If a referring page can't be update because it's locked (ex: someone is editing), it appears on an alert. You can update missed pages later by again pressing **Rename/move**.

%H% Deleting means moving the topic to the Trash web. Since all webs share the one Trash, name conflicts may come up.

%X% **NOTE:** Keep in mind that moving a topic from a view-restricted web to a public web or the Trash web will compromise security.
