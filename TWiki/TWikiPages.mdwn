%TOC%

Each page in a TWiki web is called a **_topic_**, defined by its meaningful, descriptive %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord title.

## <a name="Page_Features"> Page Features </a>

A TWiki topic is a self-contained information unit rich in features:

* a [[WikiWord]] title that lets you:
  * instantly identify what the page is about
  * automatically link to it from other pages
* an edit-anywhere collaboration area where you can:
  * enter plain or fully-HTML formatted text
  * work with simple TWiki editing shorthand (that includes HTML mark-up and special TWiki functions)
  * include Web links, images, anything else you can put on a Web page
* an extra [[TWikiDocumentation]] option:
  * store structured info alongside the free-form page content
  * use text fields and boxes, radio buttons, pulldown selector menus, checkboxes
  * select from one or many different input forms, with all data preserved
* a [[FileAttachment]] feature that lets you:
  * upload files through your browser to the TWiki server
  * attach any type of file (documents, images, applications) for viewing or downloading
  * make changes and update existing files
* [[TWikiDocumentation]] work on the web level, but can also be used to customize the look of headers and footers on a single pages
* browser-based controls for renaming, moving, and deleting pages:
  * rename a page and automatically update all the references to it, site-wide
  * move a page from one TWiki web to another
  * safely delete a topic to a special Trash web (invisible, but accessible to the TWiki administrators if needed)
* flexible [[TWikiDocumentation]]:
  * independently determine who can see, edit, rename, move or delete topics
  * set permissions by individual users and user groups

Depending on the set-up of your TWiki site and your own user account, you have several or all of the above.

## <a name="How_to_rename_move_or_delete_a_p"> How to rename, move or delete a page </a>

You can now rename, move and delete individual topics from your browser. All three options are available by clicking **More** on the control strip at the bottom of every page. The access settings for a topic, web or entire site may be disabled for one or more of the three options. In any case, all three are similar and extremely self-explanatory.

1. On the topic you want to change, click **More** &gt; **Rename/move**
2. To move or delete: select the target web (`Trash` for delete)from the pull-down menu; otherwise, leave on the current web
3. To rename: fill in a new [[WikiName]] (otherwise, leave the current topic name)
4. To update occurrences of the topic name on other pages: From the list of pages that link to the topic, check or uncheck each entry as you desire - only checked links will be updated;
5. Click **Rename/move**: the topic will be renamed and links to the topic updated.
  * Any problems are listed ; you can change them later.
  * If a referring page can't be update because it's locked (ex: someone's editing), it appears on an alert. You can missed pages later by again pressing **Rename/move**.

**Note:** Deleting means moving the topic to the Trash web. Since all webs share the one Trash, name conflicts may come up.

**Note:** Keep in mind that moving a topic from a view restricted web to a public web or the Trash web will compromize security.
