Why? What is this about?

OK, this clearly doesn't exist today. However there is some discussion on the TWiki: website.

I'm interested in this area because I am in addition to my work here running the TWiki:Codev/TWikiIRC channel. In there I have implemented a Chump IRC -&gt; XML blogging robot. I'm having fun with it too even if I need to script the XML conversion and have put it off for much too long.

I think there will one day be a reorganization of the way that TWiki does notifications for email and the RSS feeds, combining them into a flexible channel. Blogs are one outlet (or maybe just an inlet) for collaborative information sharing. I'll keep my eye on this area for now.
