I'm so excited to be working with w3m and my favorite editor right now editing this topic!

When Debian installs w3m I also chose to install some enhancements.

<dl>
  <dt> w3m</dt>
  <dd> (from .../archives/w3m_0.3.1-3_i386.deb) - the main package </dd>
  <dt> libgc6</dt>
  <dd> (from .../libgc6_1%3a6.0+6.1alpha4-3_i386.deb) - a needed library </dd>
  <dt> w3m-ssl</dt>
  <dd> (from .../w3m-ssl_0.3-2_i386.deb) - ssl support, I haven't tried this yet. </dd>
  <dt> w3m-el</dt>
  <dd> (from .../w3m-el_1.3.3-2_all.deb) - emacs integration </dd>
  <dt> w3m-img</dt>
  <dd> (from .../w3m-img_0.3.1-3_i386.deb) - image support </dd>
</dl>

I have not fully explored it yet, but the image support is not too bad! I'm using a kconsole xterm and the images are rendered (somehow) over the top. The rendering leaves behind artifacts, the images pop on and off as I scroll through the document, but this is wonderful!

Another trick I used so that the key mappings were something I am familiar with is described in /usr/share/doc/w3m/README.Debian. I changed to use the lynx keyboard commands. I simply ran this command to make it work like my fingers already know how to operate pretty well:

`cp /usr/share/doc/w3m/examples/keymap.lynx ~/.w3m/keymap`

Whala!! A text based browser with image support that edits <http://hurd.gnufans.org> pages with your favorite curses-based editor.
