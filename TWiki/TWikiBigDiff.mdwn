I would like to see only the difference between two revisions from the [[WebChanges]] page.

Congratulations on your first Wiki page. I'll see what I can do! This would have to be some kind of nested search.

You can also hack a URL to a non-existing page. It will prompt to create it and you just click create. I should have told you that way to create a page as well but I forgot about it. :-)

Hi James!

I think you're a bit confused. The [[WebChanges]] topic lists what topics in a web that have been changed recently (maybe the "recently" needs a bit of modification?). I think you're after the "View Diffs" function, which currently shows diffs from the 5 last revisions of a selected topic. This can, of course, be changed with the GNUskin.

If you check out my home topic, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] [[WIKIHOMEURLMainJoachimNilssonrawon]], you can see how I used a preference variable to change the displayed number of revisions to 2. Personal settings can always be made in the home topic like this. For **inspiration** you can look at the [[WebPreferences]] and the [[TWikiPreferences]].
