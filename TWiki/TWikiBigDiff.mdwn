I would like to see only the difference between two revisions from the [[WebChanges]] page.

Congratulations on your first Wiki page. I'll see what I can do! This would have to be some kind of nested search.

You can also hack a URL to a non-existing page. It will prompt to create it and you just click create. I should have told you that way to create a page as well but I forgot about it. :-)
