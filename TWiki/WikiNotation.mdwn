TWiki links topics automatically, provided you give a [[WikiTopic]] a name that follows the [[WikiNotation]]. It is a sequence of:

* Uppercase letter(s)
* Lowercase letter(s)
* Uppercase letter(s)
* Optional lowercase or uppercase letter(s) or number(s)

Good examples for topic names:

* [[TWikiWeb]]
* [[GoodStyle]]
* [[AVeryLongTWikiTopicNameIsAlsoPossible]]
* [[ProblemY2K]]

Bad examples for topic names:

* Web: Name with no uppercase letter in between
* T5Wiki: Name with number before the first lowercase letter
* Know-How: Name with dashes in between

Sometimes you have to be creative to find a good name for a [[WikiTopic]]. For example, if you want to create a topic about the year 2000 problem, you could go for [[FixY2K]] or [[YearTwoK]] or [[YearTwoThousand]], but not Year2K or Y2K or Y2000 as a topic name.
