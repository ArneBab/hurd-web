## <a name="Small_ToDo_list_for_the_GnuSkin"> </a> Small ToDo list for the [[GnuSkin]]

Please use the TWiki:Plugins/GnuSkinPluginDev topic for discussions regarding the GNUskin.

The leading theme for all work that I do was given to me by my English teacher at university. He said; when writing text you always do too much. The beauty lies in short concise sentences. To make it easier for us to understand he repeatedly stated:

_Simplify, simplify, simplify!_

There is actually a book written on this very topic. To emphasize the subject even further, and contrasting with popular works of today, the book is brief and straight to the point. If you don't believe me, read [Elements of Style](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0205191584/paradigmonlinewr/102-3410829-5714537), William Strunk &amp; E. B. White.

### <a name="Release_1_2"> Release 1.2 </a>

The current branch for the TWiki:Codev/AthensRelease

**_Pending:_**

* Reintroduce the preview - people seem to want it back.

* Document the [[WebMenu]] changes, e.g., how Edit Menu defaults to edit the [[TWiki/WebMenu]] when the current web does not have a WebMenu topic. To use per-web specific menus one has to first create that WebMenu topic.

* Implement a better TWiki:Codev/GoIsSearch for the search field. The semantics are already descibed on TWiki, so an implementation shouldn't take too long to cook up.

* Fix CSS:
  * Visited links should not have the same color as non-visited links.
    * Merge vmlinux.org's CSS - it has proven to be very good.
  * Add more "empty" templates that include the style sheet. The [[GnuSkin]] does not provide replacement remplates for all cases yet, this creates a mixed user experience.

* Look at some neat DHTML scripts for the [[WebMenu]] and the More button.
  * Disable per default - document howto include them.
  * Consider enabling these through a preferences variable.

**_Fixed:_**

* Only the printer icon in the toolbar looks OK in IE. (In Mozilla everything looks perfect...)
  * Could it be using a cleaner 250 color palette than the rest?
    * Yes, it seems so. The printer icon used an indexed palette of 127 colors. The others used mixups of various possible color settings.
  * Hopefully I can sort this out and also fix the rounded edges display issue at the same time.
  * Check how this change affects NS4.7
    * IE looks better after this fix - NS4 however, is not affected. Perhaps supply a separate GIF patch for sites with lot of old NS4 clients?
  * FIXED
    * First I thought IE wouldn't display transparent PNG's at all, but now I now.

* CVS version per 2003-02-18 will not show icons correctly in Netscape 4.79/Solaris. Only the "More" icon is shown. See snapshot below.

![gnuskin-icon-problem.png](%ATTACHURLPATH%/gnuskin-icon-problem.png)

* Display problem in NS 4.79 solved. Was caused by HTML being mangled resulting in a lost close tag for TD. Attached diff against twiki.gnu.tmpl is the cure.
  * FIXED. <br /> Reported by TWiki:Main.StefanLindmark - 21 Feb 2003

* The [[SmiliesPlugin]] detects an emoticon in the hidden Gnu head and replaces it with an image, breaking the HTML.
  * FIXED, similar fix checked in. <br /> Reported by TWiki:Main.StefanLindmark - 21 Feb 2003

* The LINK directive is parsed wrong in the Perl module, Chris has a fix.
  * FIXED

* Moved the "Topic parents:" to the bottom of the page again. The default skin keeps it there and it messes up the look anyhow. This one will probably make a lot of people a bit upset - tough. This is GPL'ed so fork away if you care or provide a patch to make it site/user configurable.

* "Cancel Edit"
  * FIXED

* The disturbing JavaScript stuff from the edit template is removed in CVS

* Batched diffs is checked in, there is still things todo but existing code is sufficient. The following is an example of how the documentation could read:
  * Revisions to show when using "View Diffs" in the GNUskin.
    * Set GNUSKINPLUGIN\_NUMREVISIONS = 2

### <a name="Release_2_0"> Release 2.0 </a>

The new 2.x branch intended for TWiki:Codev/BeijingRelease will contain mostly the same code as the 1.2 release. With a few small additions:

**_Pending:_**

* I18N fixes for the 2.0 release. The Beijing release prompts this, see TWiki:Plugins/InternationalisingYourSkin. Stefan has supplied a patch below! :-)

* Add option to turn preview mode off.
  * Perhaps delay this after 2.0?

* _Roll back to topic revision X_
  * Perhaps delay this after 2.0?

* Other adaptations for the Beijing release of TWiki?
  * Read up on TWiki.org

**_Fixed:_**

* Another bug related to 01Feb2003 release. EDITBOXSTYLE is not supported by [[GnuSkin]]. Modify edit.gnu.tmpl and add style="%EDITBOXSTYLE%" to the textarea tag and it will work with automatic edit area just as the TWiki skin. Same HTML as in `edit.tmpl`.
  * FIXED. <br />Reported by TWiki:Main.StefanLindmark - 24 Feb 2003

### <a name="Future_releases"> Future releases </a>

* I would **so** much like to have two buttons in edit mode: "Save Now!" and "Preview First"
  * Maybe someone else is working on this, TWiki:Main.ColasNahaboo? See TWiki:Codev/SavemultiCgiScript

* The [[WebMenu]] could use some animations, maybe this is possible if we can detect java script in a better fashion than is done in the [[TigerSkin]]?

* Separate the side bar, the [[WebMenu]], from the [[GnuSkinPlugin]].

* Parametrisize more.
  * User configurable everything, as far as possible.
  * The top logo could perhaps be removed altogether, and/or be more user customizable.
  * Fix the CSS stuff - one should be able to use a style sheet that "matches" the chosen web color better. (matches/complements/whatever).
  * Use customizable menu. Be able to use the standard TWiki menus?

### <a name="Comments_and_User_Supplied_Patch"> Comments and User Supplied Patches </a>

Created this brainstorm topic for the [[GnuSkin]]. Mostly for my own usage, but probably useful to others as well.

-- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 17 Feb 2003

I18N modifications required to use new I18N features in TWiki incorporated into templates. Please see attached diff file for diffs againt [[GnuSkin]] CVS 2003-02-18.
