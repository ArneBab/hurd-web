## <a name="Small_ToDo_list_for_the_GnuSkin"> </a> Small ToDo list for the [[GnuSkin]]

**_Introduction:_**

Please use the TWiki:Plugins/GnuSkinPluginDev topic for discussions regarding the GNUskin.

The leading theme for all my work was given to me by my English teacher at university. He said; "Writers always do too much. The beauty lies in short concise sentences." To make it easier for us to understand he paced the lecture hall and repeatedly stated:

_Simplify, simplify, simplify!_

There is a book written on this which emphasizes my point even further. The book is brief and straight to the point. If you don't believe me, read [Elements of Style](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0205191584/paradigmonlinewr/102-3410829-5714537) by William Strunk &amp; E. B. White.

**_Latest News:_**

CVS available from Savannah, <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/twiki-skins>

Development is progressing smoothly. If you would like to see the latest [[GnuSkin]] you can visit my personal web below. I do not make any promises on user experience or even if the site is up and running w/o bugs ... beware of bleeding edge!

Use the sand box for tests and fooling around.

### <a name="Release_1_2"> Release 1.2 </a>

The current 1.x branch for the TWiki:Codev/AthensRelease of TWiki. This is currently HEAD of the CVS tree, but after the 1.2 release it will go into its own 1.x branch for separate maintenance.

**_Pending:_**

* Document the [[WebMenu]] changes, e.g., how Edit Menu defaults to edit the [[TWiki/WebMenu]] when the current web does not have a WebMenu topic. To use per-web specific menus one has to first create that WebMenu topic.

* Enable checkpoint save from preferences setting.
* Display mouse-over help on Go/Search button.
* Test new features, e.g., if LINK directive in [[WebMenu]] works better

* Fix CSS:
  * Visited links should not have the same color as non-visited links.
    * IMPORTANT
    * Merge vmlinux.org's CSS - it has proven to be very good.
  * Blue and Green style is available - add other complementary colors as well. This is useful to contrast with the web colors! (Maybe delay this for future releases?)

* Add more "empty" templates that include the style sheet. The [[GnuSkin]] does not provide replacement templates for all cases yet, this can be confusing for the user experience.
  * See attaching documents for an example
  * Some templates are not yet updated to use the new CSS scheme either. All style files can be suffixed with a color to choose a unique link text color for different webs (blue and green currently). Fix this too!
  * IMPORTANT

**_Fixed:_**

* Implement a better TWiki:Codev/GoIsSearch for the search field. The semantics are already descibed on TWiki, so an implementation shouldn't take too long to cook up.
  * Used a modified version of PhotonSearch
  * IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED -- NOT IN CVS YET

* Reintroduce the preview - people seem to want it back.
  * Two buttons in edit mode: "Save Now!" and "Preview First"
    * Maybe enable the checkpoint save from preferences?
  * if (GNUSKIN\_PREVIEW == true) then open preview.gnu.tmpl else save\_immediately fi
  * Use the TWiki:Codev/SavemultiCgiScript by TWiki:Main/ColasNahaboo
  * IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED -- NOT IN CVS YET

* Only the printer icon in the toolbar looks OK in IE. (In Mozilla everything looks perfect...)
  * Could it be using a cleaner 250 color palette than the rest?
    * Yes, it seems so. The printer icon used an indexed palette of 127 colors. The others used mixups of various possible color settings.
  * Hopefully I can sort this out and also fix the rounded edges display issue at the same time.
  * Check how this change affects NS4.7
    * IE looks better after this fix - NS4 however, is not affected. Perhaps supply a separate GIF patch for sites with lot of old NS4 clients?
  * FIXED
    * First I thought IE wouldn't display transparent PNG's at all, but now I now.

* CVS version per 2003-02-18 will not show icons correctly in Netscape 4.79/Solaris. Only the "More" icon is shown. See snapshot below.

![gnuskin-icon-problem.png](%ATTACHURLPATH%/gnuskin-icon-problem.png)

* Display problem in NS 4.79 solved. Was caused by HTML being mangled resulting in a lost close tag for TD. Attached diff against twiki.gnu.tmpl is the cure.
  * FIXED. <br /> Reported by TWiki:Main.StefanLindmark - 21 Feb 2003

* The [[SmiliesPlugin]] detects an emoticon in the hidden Gnu head and replaces it with an image, breaking the HTML.
  * FIXED, similar fix checked in. <br /> Reported by TWiki:Main.StefanLindmark - 21 Feb 2003

* The LINK directive is parsed wrong in the Perl module, Chris has a fix.
  * FIXED

* Moved the "Topic parents:" to the bottom of the page again. The default skin keeps it there and it messes up the look of 1.1 anyhow. This one will probably make a lot of people a bit upset - tough. This is GPL'ed code so fork away if you care or provide a patch to make it site/user configurable.

* "Cancel Edit"
  * FIXED

* The disturbing JavaScript stuff from the edit template is removed in CVS

* Batched diffs is checked in, there is still things todo but existing code is sufficient. The following is an example of how the documentation could read:
  * Revisions to show when using "View Diffs" in the GNUskin.
    * Set GNUSKINPLUGIN\_NUMREVISIONS = 2

### <a name="Release_2_0"> Release 2.0 </a>

The new 2.x branch (becomes head after release of 1.2) intended for TWiki:Codev/BeijingRelease will contain mostly the same code as the 1.2 release. With a few small additions:

**_Pending:_**

* I18N fixes for the 2.0 release. The Beijing release prompts this, see TWiki:Plugins/InternationalisingYourSkin. Stefan has supplied a patch below! :-)

* _Roll back to topic revision X_
  * Perhaps delay this after 2.0?

* Other adaptations for the Beijing release of TWiki?
  * Read up on TWiki.org

**_Fixed:_**

* Another bug related to 01Feb2003 release. EDITBOXSTYLE is not supported by [[GnuSkin]]. Modify edit.gnu.tmpl and add style="%EDITBOXSTYLE%" to the textarea tag and it will work with automatic edit area just as the TWiki skin. Same HTML as in `edit.tmpl`.
  * FIXED. <br />Reported by TWiki:Main.StefanLindmark - 24 Feb 2003

* Add option to turn preview mode off.
  * Perhaps delay this after 2.0?
  * Added to 1.2 using the savemulti scipt by Colas. The user can now select either to preview or directly save any changes made, or cancel them altogether.

### <a name="Future_releases"> Future releases </a>

* Separate the side bar, the [[WebMenu]], from the [[GnuSkinPlugin]].
  * After 2.0!

* Look at some neat DHTML scripts for the [[WebMenu]] and the More button.
  * Disable per default - document howto include them.
  * Consider enabling these through a preferences variable.

* Parametrisize more.
  * User configurable everything, as far as possible.
  * The top logo could perhaps be removed altogether, and/or be more user customizable.
  * Fix the CSS stuff - one should be able to use a style sheet that "matches" the chosen web color better. (matches/complements/whatever).
  * Use customizable menu. Be able to use the standard TWiki menus?

### <a name="Comments_and_User_Supplied_Patch"> Comments and User Supplied Patches </a>

This brainstorm topic for the [[GnuSkin]] was mostly for myselft, but has proved probably useful to others as well.

-- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 17 Feb 2003

I18N modifications required to use new I18N features in TWiki incorporated into templates. Please see attached diff file for diffs againt [[GnuSkin]] CVS 2003-02-18.
