## <a name="Small_ToDo_list_for_the_GnuSkin"> </a> Small ToDo list for the [[GnuSkin]]

* Only the printer icon in the toolbar looks OK in IE.
  * Could it be using a cleaner 250 color palette than the rest?
  * First I thought IE wouldn't display transparent PNG's at all, but now I now.
  * Hopefully I can sort this out and also fix the rounded edges display issue at the same time.

* Reintroduce the preview - people seem to want it back.
* The LINK directive is parsed wrong in the Perl module, Chris has a fix.

* **_Release 1.2_**
  * ... "Cancel Edit" and other neat stuff is already in CVS.

* I18N fixes for the 2.0 release. The Beijing release prompts this.

* Other adaptations for the Beijing release of TWiki.

* **_Release 2.0_**

* I would **so** much like to have two buttons in edit mode: "Save Now!" and "Preview First"
  * Maybe someone else is working on this Colas Naboo (sp?)?

* The [[WebMenu]] could use some animations, maybe this is possible if we can detect java script in a better fashion than is done in the [[TigerSkin]]?

* Implement a better [[GoIsSearch]] for the search field. The semantics are already descibed on TWiki, so an implementation shouldn't take too long to cook up.

* Parametrisize more.
  * The top logo could perhaps be removed altogether, and/or be more user customizable.
  * Fix the CSS stuff - one should be able to use a style sheet that "matches" the chosen web color better. (matches/complements/whatever).
  * Use customizable menu. Be able to use the standard TWiki menus?

### <a name="Comments_"> Comments? </a>

Created this brain storm topic for the [[GnuSkin]]. Mostly for my own usage, but probably useful for others as well.
