## <a name="Small_ToDo_list_for_the_GnuSkin"> </a> Small ToDo list for the [[GnuSkin]]

Please use the TWiki:Plugins/GnuSkinPluginDev topic for discussions regarding the [[GnuSkin]].

* The leading theme for everything I do with the [[GnuSkin]] was given to me by my English teacher at univeristy: _Simplify, simplify, simplify!_

### <a name="Release_1_2"> Release 1.2 </a>

The current branch for the TWiki:Codev/AthensRelease

**_Pending:_**

* Only the printer icon in the toolbar looks OK in IE.
  * Could it be using a cleaner 250 color palette than the rest?
    * Yes, it seems so. The printer icon used an indexed palette of 127 colors.
  * First I thought IE wouldn't display transparent PNG's at all, but now I now.
  * Hopefully I can sort this out and also fix the rounded edges display issue at the same time.

* Reintroduce the preview - people seem to want it back.
* The LINK directive is parsed wrong in the Perl module, Chris has a fix.
* Batched diffs:
  * First "click" on Diffs brings up the diffs for the last five (document the %NO\_OF\_DIFFS% variable) (or less if not applicable) revisions.
* Document the [[WebMenu]] changes, e.g., how Edit Menu defaults to edit the [[TWiki/WebMenu]].
* Fix CSS:
  * Visited links should not have the same color as non-visited links.
  * Add more "empty" templates that include the style sheet. The [[GnuSkin]] does not provide replacement remplates for all cases yet.

**_Fixed:_**

* ... "Cancel Edit" is already in CVS
* ... the disturbing [[JavaScript]] stuff from the edit template is removed in CVS

### <a name="Release_2_0"> Release 2.0 </a>

The new 2.x branch intended for TWiki:Codev/BeijingRelease

**_Pending:_**

* I18N fixes for the 2.0 release. The Beijing release prompts this, see TWiki:Plugins/InternationalisingYourSkin

* Add option to turn preview mode off.

* _Roll back to topic revision X_

* Other adaptations for the Beijing release of TWiki.

**_Fixed:_**

### <a name="Future_releases"> Future releases </a>

* I would **so** much like to have two buttons in edit mode: "Save Now!" and "Preview First"
  * Maybe someone else is working on this Colas Nahaboo? See TWiki:Codev/SavemultiCgiScript

* The [[WebMenu]] could use some animations, maybe this is possible if we can detect java script in a better fashion than is done in the [[TigerSkin]]?

* Separate the side bar, the [[WebMenu]], from the [[GnuSkinPlugin]].

* Implement a better [[GoIsSearch]] for the search field. The semantics are already descibed on TWiki, so an implementation shouldn't take too long to cook up.

* Parametrisize more.
  * User configurable everything, as far as possible.
  * The top logo could perhaps be removed altogether, and/or be more user customizable.
  * Fix the CSS stuff - one should be able to use a style sheet that "matches" the chosen web color better. (matches/complements/whatever).
  * Use customizable menu. Be able to use the standard TWiki menus?

### <a name="Comments_"> Comments? </a>

Created this brain storm topic for the [[GnuSkin]]. Mostly for my own usage, but probably useful for others as well.
