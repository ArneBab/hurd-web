* Only the "Print":er icon in the toolbar looks OK in IE. First I thought IE wouldn't display transparent PNG's at all, but now I now.
* Reintroduce the preview - it seems people want it back.
* The LINK directive is parsed wrong in the Perl module, Chris has a fix.

* Release 1.2 ... "Cancel Edit" and other neat stuff is already in CVS.
