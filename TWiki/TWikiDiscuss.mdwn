This is an area to talk about how the Hurd Wiki pages are put together, edited and arranged. Without organization the navigation of the site could become unusable.

If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm available almost every waken hour.

Please add your comments below and then your signature, Blog style.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

* Preview back.
* Better support for Interner Explorer (tested on 5.5 and 6.0)
* CSS updates - different color for visited links.
* and more ...
