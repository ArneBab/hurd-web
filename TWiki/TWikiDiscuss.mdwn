If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm available almost every waken hour.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Wouldn't it be cool to have a Wiki on Savannah? It would greatly simplify maintenance of project home pages, for instance. The possibilities are endless it's only the reoccurring issue of actually implementing the idea ...

Yes, this trial data may move to a central resources sometime. Savannah would be a good place, but also perhaps (maybe) to www.gnu.org. Right now this wiki can be linked to from anywhere. Oh, we might want to think about a nice comprehensive redirect method which shouldn't be too once we know where the data has moved to.

We should create a template to make pages here look identical to the <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages. [Done, 4th July -- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]]]

Should we perhaps disable [[TWikiGuest]] as a viable user for editing content on the Hurd web? Just a thought that crossed my mind.

-- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 11 Jun 2002

Do you think that disabling it would significantly effect the copyright assignment issues or help us in some other way? In talking with others on #hurd and helping them create new pages (just a few) there still seems to be significant resistance to setting themselves up with an ID. Human nature I guess. I feel it may be advantageous to keep it available as an option but we can make it less prominent, perhaps moving it to the hosting page or something like that.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 11 Jun 2002

No, not really. It was just a thought I had ...

Sure, move anything you want off the front page. Focus on content, **real** content and remove anything not directly applicable to the Hurd! Anyone interested in TWiki stuff will find that out for themselves.

At long last, the [[TWiki/GnuSkinPlugin]] has reached beta status. The Hurd web is the first to be the real testing ground for it. Please report any trouble to yours truly before complaining at the page authors. :-)

The [[WebMenu]] is in dire need of someone fixing the contents of. I can do the manual editing to make it look good if someone tells me what we should have on it.

I suggest shortcuts to various more important topics. See the page [[TWiki/ManagingTopics]] for info on renaming, moving and administering topics in the TWiki to do this in the Right Way<sup>TM</sup>.
