Sure, go ahead! If you need anything server related done just send me an email, as usual.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Another idea I've been having.

Wouldn't it be cool to have a Wiki on Savannah? It would greatly simplify maintenance of project home pages, for instance. The possibilities are endless it's only the reoccurring issue of actually implementing the idea ...

Yes, this trial data may move to a central resources sometime. Savannah would be a good place, but also perhaps (maybe) to www.gnu.org. Right now this wiki can be linked to from anywhere. Oh, we might want to think about a nice comprehensive redirect method which shouldn't be too once we know where the data has moved to.

The [[WebNotify]] function needs your attention when you get a chance. Here's the [documentation](http://vmlinux.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TWikiDocumentation#WebNotify_Recent_Changes_Alert).

We should create a template to make pages here look identical to the <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages.
