If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm on stand by almost every waken hour.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Another idea I've been having.

Wouldn't it be cool to have a Wiki on Savannah? It would greatly simplify maintenance of project home pages, for instance. The possibilities are endless it's only the reoccurring issue of actually implementing the idea ...

Yes, this trial data may move to a central resources sometime. Savannah would be a good place, but also perhaps (maybe) to www.gnu.org. Right now this wiki can be linked to from anywhere. Oh, we might want to think about a nice comprehensive redirect method which shouldn't be too once we know where the data has moved to.

We should create a template to make pages here look identical to the <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages.

I've redone the [[Know/WebHome]] in favor of my newly developed [[TWiki/GnuSkin]] plugin. It is designed with the current <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages in mind.

Everything in the Knowledge web is customizable and as soon as you people have looked at it I'll start configuring the Hurd web to look the same.

Fixed.

Question: Should we perhaps disable [[TWikiGuest]] as a viable user for editing content on the Hurd web? Just a thought that crossed my mind.

-- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 11 Jun 2002

Thanks for fixing that. Do you think that disabling it would significantly effect the copyright assignment issues or help us in some other way? In talking with others on #hurd and helping them create new pages (just a few) there still seems to be significant resistance to setting themselves up with an ID. Human nature I guess. I feel it may be advantageous to keep it available as an option but we can make it less prominent, perhaps moving it to the hosting page or something like that.
