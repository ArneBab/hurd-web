If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm available almost every waken hour.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Hopefully with some time over the holidays we can finish this multi-"TWiki Web" migration. and move forward. I'm feeling pretty good about it with the exception of one [[InstallNotes]] topic. Heh.

Good, we have consensus.

The [[InstallNotes]] ... how about separating it into

<dl>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Install Guide</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/InstallGuide">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Neals' Installation Guide (verbatim copy, separate license GPL) </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Install Notes</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/InstallNotes">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Our (the users') notes and addendums to the guide, somthing of an errata for Neal. Under the FDL, as we should license everything in the Hurd Wiki ... </dd>
</dl>

What I hate is tip-toing around a good base but stale document that the community respects (Neal's guide) instead of having one resource we all work together on. It's confusing for us and for users, damn it. I'm going to wait and see what comes of the email transactions flying around and then maybe hit Neal up myself and try to join forces in a more graceful manner.

I also renamed this topic from HurdTWikiDiscuss to WebDiscussII. I don't recall why we had this relatively new one and the old [[WebDiscuss]] both, but it was probably changed context now that there are more webs floating around to use!

As it's now December 28th, We are getting close to our organization goal of 2003! What else do we need to do? I want to move more stuff from [[Hurd/WebHome]] but some of it has to do with people which I feel most logically belongs to [[Main/WebHome]] yet it would be buried under the text editing function of that particular page rather than the introductory topic that is done for every other "TWiki web" here.
