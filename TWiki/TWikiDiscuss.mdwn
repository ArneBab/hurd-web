Sure, go ahead! If you need anything server related done just send me an email, as usual.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Another idea I've been having.

Wouldn't it be cool to have a Wiki on Savannah? It would greatly simplify maintenance of project home pages, for instance. The possibilities are endless it's only the reoccurring issue of actually implementing the idea ...

Yes, this trial data may move to a central resources sometime. Savannah would be a good place, but also perhaps (maybe) to www.gnu.org. Right now this wiki can be linked to from anywhere. Oh, we might want to think about a nice comprehensive redirect method which shouldn't be too once we know where the data has moved to.

The [[WebNotify]] function needs your attention when you get a chance. Here's the [documentation](http://vmlinux.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TWikiDocumentation#WebNotify_Recent_Changes_Alert).

We should create a template to make pages here look identical to the <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages.

I think I fixed the [[WebNotify]] stuff yesterday. At least I put some effort into it and this morning I got an error reply from the cron daemon pointing out the last overlook from my side. So we should be getting emails once a day now ... any day.

Templates sounds good, how do we do that? Or, tell me where to put it when it's done. :)

How about that notice from [[Main/PeterThoeny]]? Why don't we change the [[WebPreferences]] for the Hurd web to say "Copyright (c) 2002 Free Software Foundation", instead of the usual "... the contributing authors". I think that would make the information we put in here easier to move around among different webs (not only Wikified ones...). Perhaps also add a notice on licensing? Like this:

    "Copyright (C) 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
