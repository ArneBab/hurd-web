This is an area to talk about how the Hurd Wiki pages are put together, edited and arranged. Without organization the navigation of the site could become unusable.

If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm available almost every waken hour.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

I just saw the GNU head in the mini icon of my mozilla browser URL entry window. Very cool! When did you put that in?

Not so long ago, I think it was around the 1st Jan.

Look out, I found a new TWiki goodie on Codev.

Here's [another dangerous idea](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/ShorterURLs) again harping on shorter URLs. Can this be implemented in addition to the current scheme? I'll read closely and try to figure this out for myself as well for my friend who wants a new install.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 10 Jan 2003

Oh, this looks dangerous! I think we should hold off on this until later, preferrably until it is more widely tested and perhaps "recommended" from the installation topics in upcoming releases of TWiki.

You should see the redirects we already have, they are awful.

Here comes another crazy site-wide idea. I was just looking at the [Webalizer data](http://hurd.gnufans.org/webalizer/). The number of visits is increasing pretty quickly. I also found some [discussion of a Webalizer Plugin](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/WebalizerStatistics) on twiki.org.

A temporary work around I was thinking of doing is edit the [[WebStatistics]] pages for the various webs to link to your Webalizer. Before I do that I wanted to discuss this with you.

For [[Hurd/WebStatistics]] I just edited the topic to include the Webalizer URL in it. Might we be able to help with developing a Webalizer Plugin (or Add-On, whichever is appropriate) for TWiki to solve the general case? I'm ready to check in some stuff to a new module in the CVS you have created for the Gnu Skin on Savannah. I'm willing to learn what it will take. What do you think?

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 10 Jan 2003

Sure, we could have the [[WebStatistics]] reference the Webalizer, that could be useful.

Email me your user name on Savannah and I'll add you to the developers list on the twiki-skins project. Setup a topic that we can discuss the plugin on - I might get some time over to work on it as well.

Here's an idea that seems almost profane at the beginning but is something I'd like to see installed on this site. [Spaced Wiki Word Plugin](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/SpacedWikiWordPlugin) could be globally disabled, but it's a nice feature for those that would prefer it. Outsiders won't get thrown off by the funny character spacing. This could be very useful in improving adoption. What do you think, Joachim?

Oops, I'm on a rampage! [FindElsewherePlugin](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/FindElsewherePlugin) too. Both were at least inspired by [MartinCleaver](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Main/MartinCleaver).
