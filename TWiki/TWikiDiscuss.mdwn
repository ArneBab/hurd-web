# <a name="Wiki_Meta_Discussions"> Wiki Meta Discussions </a>

This is an area to talk about how the Hurd Wiki pages are put together, edited and arranged. Without organization the navigation of the site could become unusable.

Please add your comments below and then your signature, Blog style.

If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm available almost every waken hour.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Hopefully with some time over the holidays we can finish this multi-"TWiki Web" migration. and move forward. I'm feeling pretty good about it with the exception of one [[Hurd/InstallNotes]] topic. Heh.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 22 Dec 2002

Good, we have consensus.

The [[Hurd/InstallNotes]] ... how about separating it into

<dl>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Install Guide</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/InstallGuide">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Neals' Installation Guide (verbatim copy, separate license GPL) </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Install Notes</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/InstallNotes">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Our (the users') notes and addendums to the guide, somthing of an errata for Neal. Under the FDL, as we should license everything in the Hurd Wiki ... </dd>
</dl>

What I hate is tip-toing around a good base but stale document that the community respects (Neal's guide) instead of having one resource we all work together on. It's confusing for us and for users, damn it. I'm going to wait and see what comes of the email transactions flying around and then maybe hit Neal up myself and try to join forces in a more graceful manner.

I also renamed this topic from HurdTWikiDiscuss to TWiki.TWikiDiscuss. I don't recall why we had this relatively new one and the old [[Hurd/WebDiscuss]] both, but it was probably changed context now that there are more webs floating around to use!

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 22 Dec 2002

I really do hope this nasty business with the install guide gets resolved soon! It's, like you say, not good for the users.

The two web discussion topics we should be able to merge somehow. I too fail to remember why we had them, but it's probably like you say.

In some other [[Hurd/WebDiscuss]] I did a back references to an earlier revision of a topic and deleted the old stuff - keeping the reference to the older revision on the top. We could to that too with these two topics.

As it's now December 28th, We are getting close to our organization goal of 2003! What else do we need to do? I want to move more stuff from [[Hurd/WebHome]] but some of it has to do with people which I feel most logically belongs to [[Main/HurdGnuFansOrg]] yet it would be buried under the text editing function of that particular page rather than the introductory topic that is done for every other "TWiki web" here.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 29 Dec 2002

I've moved around a few topics to try and clear up things a bit.

<dl>
  <dt> Main<nop>.HurdGnuFansOrg</nop></dt>
  <dd> Moved to <span style="background:"><font color="">Hurd Gnu Fans Org Discuss</font></span><a href="http://LOCATION/HurdGnuFansOrgDiscuss">?</a></dd>
  <dt> Main<nop>.WebHome</nop></dt>
  <dd> Moved to <span style="background:"><font color="">Hurd Gnu Fans Org</font></span><a href="http://LOCATION/HurdGnuFansOrg">?</a></dd>
  <dt> Main<nop>.AdditionalNavigation</nop></dt>
  <dd> Moved to Main<nop>.WebHome </nop></dd>
  <dt> Hurd<nop>.WebDiscussII</nop></dt>
  <dd> Moved to TWiki<nop>.TWikiDiscuss (maybe we should call it <span style="background:"><font color="">Wiki Discuss</font></span><a href="http://LOCATION/WikiDiscuss">?</a>?) </nop></dd>
</dl>

I also updated the index.shtml page that generates <http://hurd.gnufans.org> accordingly.

This cleared up the [[Hurd/WebHome]] topic in the Main web so that we could finish moving the remaining topics from Hurd.WebHome to there.

You might have noticed by now that I've reintroduced the **_Cancel Edit_** feature. You where of course right from the beginning when you said it was necessary.

I have also tried hard in moving the **_Parents:_** higher up in the text frame. I cannot move it higher up now without moving it completely outside of the colored border.

If you haven't noticed it already I saw your post on [GnuSkinPluginDev](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/GnuSkinPluginDev) about the diff issue. To cut a long story short, I've partially fixed it.

* The **_Diffs_** link i regular view mode gives you the five last revisions. Or the number of revisions set in the GNUSKINPLUGIN\_NUMREVISIONS option (you can set that option in your home topic, %WIKIUSERNAME% - if it doesn't work tell me quick!).
* When you're in rdiff mode there is now an **_All Diffs_** link as well.

Oh, the WEBCOPYRIGHT setting in the [[TWikiPreferences]] has been changed to include a note on licensing of the wiki content. I'm still to incorporate what I mentioned in the [[GNU/WebDiscuss]] topic - it's WEBCOPYRIGHT is slightly different including a copyright assignment clause as well ...

(This is what I've been thinking about - it's the only way to legally assign copyright - if this is what we want?)

... something we might need to hold off with until I bring back the [Preview feature](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Support/SaveWithoutPreview). I need to add a checkbox **_Assign copyright to the FSF_**, which the user has to actively select otherwise the changes cannot be saved and the topic will loop in preview mode, or the edit has to be cancelled.

I guess this part of the discussion should go in [[Hurd/HurdWikiCopyrightDiscuss]] instead ... see Deego's talk about _Step 1_ and _Step 2_ for reference.

You posted alot more on the 29th. I'll have to catch up.

I got an idea. I just changed the WIKITOOLNAME on the global [[TWiki/TWikiPreferences]] page. Hmmm. I hope this doesn't screw up anything! I think it looks great on the upper left of every page.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 05 Jan 2003

It looks great! There are still a lot of things that I need to learn about regarding TWiki, but it's real fun so from here on I'll consider it an educating "ride".

There where some other minor side effects caused by your change, for insance, take a look at:

* [[Main/WebHome]]
* [[TWiki/TWikiRegistration]]

put the <code>**?raw=on**</code> after the URL in the location bar in your browser to see what I mean. Like this:

       http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Main/WebHome?raw=on

I don't mind at all, it just looks funny. Search for %WIKITOOLNAME% to find more examples.

-- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 07 Jan 2003

TWiki is a complex tool. It's kinda fun for me learning as well. I was proud when Peter called me last weekend and we discussed the renaming of one of the documentation pages for the next release. I feel I've arrived in the inner circle of TWiki-ness. ;-)

As for the Gnufans toolname change, I'm just glad nothing broke horribly! It would be useful (for the TWiki community) to document these unintended effects as we find them. Let's use a new page for this: [[WikiToolNameChange]] I copied the last two entries you and I made to the new page to get it started.

I just saw the GNU head in the mini icon of my mozilla browser URL entry window. Very cool! When did you put that in?
