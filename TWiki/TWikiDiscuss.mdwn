Sure, go ahead! If you need anything server related done just send me an email, as usual.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Another idea I've been having.

Wouldn't it be cool to have a Wiki on Savannah? It would greatly simplify maintenance of project home pages, for instance. The possibilities are endless it's only the reoccurring issue of actually implementing the idea ...

Yes, this trial data may move to a central resources sometime. Savannah would be a good place, but also perhaps (maybe) to www.gnu.org. Right now this wiki can be linked to from anywhere. Oh, we might want to think about a nice comprehensive redirect method which shouldn't be too once we know where the data has moved to.

We should create a template to make pages here look identical to the <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages.

Templates sounds good, how do we do that? Or, tell me where to put it when it's done. :)

Moved copyright and legal discussions to separate page, [[HurdWikiCopyrightDiscuss]].

Templates, skins, plugins ... ouch, there are a lot of things to come to terms with using [[TWiki/WebHome]].

Anyway, I've redone the [[Know/WebHome]] in favor of my newly developed [[TWiki/GnuSkin]] plugin. It is designed with the current <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages in mind.

Everything in the Knowledge web is customizable and as soon as you people have looked at it I'll start configuring the Hurd web to look the same.
