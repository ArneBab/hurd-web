This is an area to talk about how these pages are put together, edited and arranged. Without organization the navigation of the site could become unusable.

If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm available almost every waken hour.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

Wouldn't it be cool to have a Wiki on Savannah? It would greatly simplify maintenance of project home pages, for instance. The possibilities are endless it's only the reoccurring issue of actually implementing the idea ...

Should we perhaps disable [[TWikiGuest]] as a viable user for editing content on the Hurd web? Just a thought that crossed my mind.

No, not really. It was just a thought I had ...

Sure, move anything you want off the front page. Focus on content, **real** content and remove anything not directly applicable to the Hurd! Anyone interested in TWiki stuff will find that out for themselves.

At long last, the [[TWiki/GnuSkinPlugin]] has reached beta status. The Hurd web is the first to be the real testing ground for it. Please report any trouble to yours truly before complaining at the page authors. :-)

The [[WebMenu]] is in dire need of someone fixing the contents of. I can do the manual editing to make it look good if someone tells me what we should have on it.

I suggest shortcuts to various more important topics. See the page [[TWiki/ManagingTopics]] for info on renaming, moving and administering topics in the TWiki to do this in the Right Way<sup>TM</sup>.

Aside: I think it's time to refactor! I've refactored my comments again. I wasn't sure what you wanted to do about yours so I left them. We need to understand how best to work with this very soon IMNSHO.

Thanks for installing the [Smilies Plugin](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/SmiliesPlugin)! :-) With some of the existing IRC culture this should be very nice once people know it's available and start using it.

Peeve - One thing I think is confusing is using a different name for a web than is actually coded into twiki.cfg. If we want to rename the webs now (as I feel should be done for the whole distribution) then we need to rename them NOW. As more pages get created the name is used to give the actual name of pages: example [[Main/CloroxWork]] and I can't type in [[Users/CloroxWork]] as the web menu would imply! Navigation is critical as we go to a multiple TWiki web design.

We also need to get navigation synchronized. I very much like the way we can do [[WebMenu]] topics for each web but we need to do some QA to make them all usable. and consistent.

One thing I struggled with during my modifications of [[Hurd/WebMenu]] was where to put all the various "administrative" tools for the web we are actually using. Perhaps they should go at the bottom of the [[WebHome]] page instead of in the [[WebMenu]], but the [[WebMenu]] makes more sense from an ease of navigation viewpoint. If you are in a web and want to see the most active topics for that Web I don't want to force folks to go back to [[WebHome]] unless it's absolutely necessary. Does this make any sense or is this another pet peeve of mine that others (Joachim?) may not agree with?

I'm also confused about where some of the WebMenus are generated. On the Hurd web it's there but I don't understand where the others are auto-generated from. I'll have to defer to the GNU Skin master!

How often are the Webalizer stats run? [http://hurd.gnufans.org/webalizer/usage\_200211.html](http://hurd.gnufans.org/webalizer/usage_200211.html)
