This is an area to talk about how these pages are put together, edited and arranged. Without organization the navigation of the site could become unusable.

If you need anything server related done just send me, [[Main/JoachimNilsson]], an email. I'm available almost every waken hour.

One thing though. Refactor _mercilessly_! :-) [Yes! [[Main/GrantBow]]]

One thing I struggled with during my modifications of [[TWiki/WebMenu]] was where to put all the various "administrative" tools for the web we are actually using. Perhaps they should go at the bottom of the [[WebHome]] page instead of in the [[WebMenu]], but the [[WebMenu]] makes more sense from an ease of navigation viewpoint. If you are in a web and want to see the most active topics for that Web I don't want to force folks to go back to [[WebHome]] unless it's absolutely necessary.

I can modify the bottom of the space where the [[TWiki/WebMenu]] resides to include "Top 5" from the [[WebStatistics]] of the current web.

What do you think about adding, at least, [[WebNotify]] to the list of items listed for each web in the [[TWiki/WebMenu]]? (Preferrably at the bottom of each listing.)

How about splitting/deleting parts of this topic into TWiki.WebDiscuss and Hurd.WebDiscuss ... I think this is similar to something you suggested in an email earlier.

As you might have noticed, I renamed all \_webname\_Discuss topics to their respective [[WebDiscuss]] topic. The intention of the discussion topics was to serve as a holder for meta discussions about the wiki web organization. The name [[MachDiscuss]] or [[MigDiscuss]], for example, are better to be left to people wanting to discuss, or organize discussions, regarding Mach or Mig.

Cool, I agree. :-)

Hopefully with some time over the holidays we can finish this multi-"TWiki Web" migration. and move forward. I'm feeling pretty good about it with the exception of one [[InstallNotes]] topic. Heh.

-- [[Main/GrantBow]] - 22 Dec 2002

Good, we have consensus.

The [[InstallNotes]] ... how about separating it into

<dl>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Install Guide</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/InstallGuide">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Neals' Installation Guide (verbatim copy, separate license GPL) </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Install Notes</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/InstallNotes">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Our (the users') notes and addendums to the guide, somthing of an errata for Neal. Under the FDL, as we should license everything in the Hurd Wiki ... </dd>
</dl>

What I hate is tip-toing around a good base but stale document that the community respects (Neal's guide) instead of having one resource we all work together on. It's confusing for us and for users, damn it. I'm going to wait and see what comes of the email transactions flying around and then maybe hit Neal up myself and try to join forces in a more graceful manner.

I also renamed this topic from HurdTWikiDiscuss to WebDiscussII. I don't recall why we had this relatively new one and the old [[WebDiscuss]] both, but it was probably changed context now that there are more webs floating around to use!
