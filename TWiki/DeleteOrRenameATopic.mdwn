How do I delete or rename a topic?

## <a name="Answer_"> Answer: </a>

New to the 01-Sep-2001 version of TWiki, you can rename, move and delete topics directly from your browser (previously, these operations could only be done manually, by someone with file-level access to the Web server).

Moving lets you transfer a topic from one web to another. The soft delete moves a topic to the special <code>**Trash**</code> web, where it's hidden but can be "undeleted" with system administrator access.

Click <code>**[More]**</code> on the control bar at the bottom of the page you want to change, then choose <code>**[Rename/move]**</code>, and make your changes that screen. There's a link that launches to the [[ManagingTopics]] reference page in a pop-up window.

**_NOTE:_** The configuration of your site and your own access permissions determine whether you can access these functions.
