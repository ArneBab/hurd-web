A TWiki contributor is a person devoting his/her time to contribute on the development of the Open Source project TWiki, hosted at <http://TWiki.org/> . It is defined as a person who:

I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all who contributed ideas, code, fixes and documentation.
