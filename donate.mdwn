If you feel like donating goods or money for the work the developers are doing,
then we're happy to confirm that this is indeed possible.  Of course we'd
really like to have you working with us on the system, but if you're feeling
generous we won't stop you either.

Note that you can't donate directly to the Hurd project, but only to either the
Free Software Foundation or individually to the developers.  Donations to the
Free Software Foundation are tax deducible, see <http://fsf.org/donate>.

If you've got more money on hand than hacking time, you might consider buying
some [maintenance points](http://g10code.com/products.html#maintpoints) (EUR 10 a point) to
help the Hurd along.  From the [g10 Code](http://www.g10code.com/products.html)
site:

> Hurd Maintenance Points are special: Some of our employees are well known
> Hurd hackers in their spare time; collected points for this program will be
> given to them in form of paid time.

[mailing-list](http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-hurd/2003-04/msg00044.html)
thread.

And for further motivation, some words of wisdom from Marcus Brinkmann:

Another possibility is to meet with the Hurd developers at a
[[meeting|community/meetings]] and spend them a pizza or beer or both or
similar.
