# On Posting

Before asking a question on a list, first make an effort to find the answer
to your question.  When you ask your question, (1) be details, and (2) demonstrate
that you have made an effort, e.g., "I am having trouble frobbing the foo.  I
searched the web and only found information regarding how to frob a bar, but
that seems unrelated."

List etiquette is to cc the sender and anyone **actively** involved in the
discussion. Some people don't like this and they set their reply-to header
appropriately.  Respect this.

It is rarely appropriate to cc multiple lists.  Sometimes it is.  In that case,
do so.  If in doubt, don't; just choose the single most appropriate list.
