Jeff Bailey has set up a system where you can install a Hurd system without having to use CDs. It's another type of cross-installation method which uses Debian package management tools to get the packages required as opposed to the one single big tarball.

As of 27.05.2004, the latest version of crosshurd is 1.6.2. It can be found in
