Jeff Bailey has set up a system where you can install a Hurd system without having to use CDs. It's another type of cross-installation method which uses Debian package management tools to get the packages required as opposed to the one single big tarball.

As of 2004-05-17, the latest version of crosshurd is 1.5.8. It can be found in
