A much, much better series than K1. install.sh now installs all the required, important and standard packages. gui.sh is still there, but xfree is not working at the moment. The first four of a possible five CD set has been released, the fifth is probably useless to most people. The K3 series will probably be released once xfree is working again. Phil.
