Here's a place for notes and sharing info about peculiarities with this tarball.

* Used as basis for [[CDNotesJ2]]

* When booting with grub users must use     module /hurd/ext2fs.static --readonly ... This is fixed in CVS, bug-hurd discussion [begins here](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-August/010226.html). Note that you must NOT use --readonly before your first run of ./native-install.

\* If on booting this error occurs, check your grub module lines.

    2 multiboot modules

        panic: 1 of 2 boot script commands could not be parsed

Notice there are both \{\} and () used. [[InstallNotes]]

* Marcus' new console driver is in testing and should also be included next time.

* Using GNU Mach 1.3 (as released May 28th). It does not use the actively developed GNU Mach 2.0 and oskit drivers. Hopefully the next one will after Marcus gets back from his month long travels.
