Here's a place for notes and sharing info about peculiarities with this tarball.

* When booting with grub users must use     module /hurd/ext2fs.static --readonly ... This is fixed in CVS, bug-hurd discussion [begins here](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-August/010226.html). Note that you must NOT use --readonly before your first run of ./native-install.

\* If on booting this error occurs, check your grub module lines.

    2 multiboot modules

        panic: 1 of 2 boot script commands could not be parsed

Notice there are both \{\} and () used.
