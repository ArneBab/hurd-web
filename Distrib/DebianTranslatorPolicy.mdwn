This page describes the packaging policy for translators.

<code>**Naming Scheme**</code>

Possible package naming schemes (foo is a filesystem based translator, bar is a node based translator)

\* foofs, bar [this will make searching somewhat more of a hassle]

\* foofs-trans, bar-trans

\* foofs-translator, bar-translator

\* hurd-translator-foofs, hurd-translator-bar

\* source package should be called whatever the tarball/cvs module says

\* do we need to destinguish between file system and node based translators?

<code>**Where to put files**</code>

\* They should go into /hurd

\* What about setting passive translators in /servers or /dev?

<code>**Short/Long description guidelines**</code>

[packagename]: Foo translator for [doing bar] Foo is a GNU/Hurd translator which does [bar]
