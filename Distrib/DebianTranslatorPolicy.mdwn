This page describes the packaging policy for translators.

## <a name="Naming_Scheme"> Naming Scheme </a>

Possible package naming schemes (foo is a filesystem based translator, bar is a node based translator)

* foofs, bar [this will make searching somewhat more of a hassle]

* foofs-trans, bar-trans

* foofs-translator, bar-translator

* hurd-translator-foofs, hurd-translator-bar

* source package should be called whatever the tarball/cvs module says

* do we need to destinguish between file system and node based translators?

## <a name="Where_to_put_files"> Where to put files </a>

* They should go into /hurd

* What about setting passive translators in /servers or /dev?

## <a name="Short_Long_description_guideline"> Short/Long description guidelines </a>

<dl>
  <dt> [packagename]</dt>
  <dd> Foo translator for [doing bar]<br /> Foo is a GNU/Hurd translator which does [bar] </dd>
