## <a name="Maintenance_of_the_WEB_web"> Maintenance of the %WEB% web </a>

I've setup a preliminary front page for the Distrib web. Nothing fancy, but I think it's better to have a general idea on display rather than nothing. This is your baby Grant. :)

Where should all this stuff go?

<form action="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/search%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/SearchResult">
  <ul>
    <li> %NOTIFYTOPIC%: Subscribe to be automatically notified when something changes in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB% web. </li>
    <li> %STATISTICSTOPIC%: View access statistics of the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB% web. </li>
    <li> %WEBPREFSTOPIC%: Preferences of the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB% web. </li>
  </ul>
</form>

**Notes:**

* You are currently in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB% web. The color code for this web is a (SPECIFY COLOR) background, so you know where you are.
* If you are not familiar with the %WIKITOOLNAME% collaboration tool, please visit %TWIKIWEB%.WelcomeGuest in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%TWIKIWEB% web first.

[[CDNotesHome]] no longer shows dates of releases. Is this because the spaces that are included in topic names?

Strange. Nope, the spaces in links and topic names are only visible when the wiki is presented in HTML to the user, it's a visualization plugin. The topics themselves are still searchable in the same fashion.

However, we recently had a server upgrade (woody--&gt;sarge) that may have affected the apache settings. I'll look into it and post more here later.

It is still having problems.
