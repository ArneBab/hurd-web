So you have managed to get past the first ./native-install runs in single-user mode?

Time to get to work.

If your NIC was detected by Mach:

    settrans -fgap /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet -i eth0 \
             -a 192.168.1.3 -g 192.168.1.1 -b 255.255.255.0

### <a name="_Hurd_HurdConsole_Setup_Virtual_"> </a> [[Hurd/HurdConsole]]

The latest Hurd package in Debian, plus the /native-install script, creates all necessary device nodes and other magic. You just need to call console with the proper arguments:

    console -d vga -d pc_kbd --repeat=kbd -d pc_mouse --repeat=mouse \
            -d generic_speaker -c /dev/vcs

    cd /dev
    ln -s cons/kbd .
    ln -s cons/mouse .

Assuming you've installed WindowMaker and have tried running startx already:

    [/etc/X11/XF86Config-4]

    #        Load           "speedo"
             .
             .
             .
    EndSection

    Section "InputDevice"
