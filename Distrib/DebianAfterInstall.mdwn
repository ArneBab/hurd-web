## <a name="First_steps_after_Install_"> First steps after Install. </a>

So you have managed to get past the first ./native-install runs in single-user mode?

Time to get to work.

### <a name="_Hurd_GetNetworkRunning_Setup_ne"> </a> [[Hurd/GetNetworkRunning]]

Check if your NIC was detected by GNU Mach:

    # devprobe eth0

_devprobe_ (run as user _root_) will print _eth0_ on successful detection. If it doesn't, your NIC was not detected correctly. You can then try to do the following (also as user _root_) for getting details:

    # cat /dev/klog > ~/klog
    [Wait a second, then press `Ctrl-C'.]

Now examine the _~/klog_ file.

If the NIC was detected:

    # settrans -fgap /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet -i eth0 -a 192.168.1.3 -g 192.168.1.1 -m 255.255.255.0

### <a name="Setup_grub"> Setup grub </a>

You surely want grub to have a nice menu entry able to boot GNU, instead of typing a boring arcane. There are Debian-specific scripts that may help you. See the [[GrubNotes]] for this.

### <a name="Setup_apt_get"> Setup apt-get </a>

Sometimes getting apt-get to work is not straightforward. Good mirrors to put in `/etc/apt/sources.list` are (as of Jan 2007):

    deb http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian unstable main contrib
    deb-src http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian unstable main contrib
    deb http://ftp.gnuab.org/debian unreleased main
    deb-src http://ftp.gnuab.org/debian unreleased main

apt-get update a couple of times if some file fails to download.

If when doing your first apt-get, dpkg complains of missing programs, [try to cheat it this way](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/1999/05/msg00187.html):

    # ln -s /sbin/ldconfig /bin/ldconfig
    # ln -s /bin/true /bin/update-rc.d
    # ln -s /bin/true /bin/start-stop-daemon
    # ln -s /bin/true /bin/install-info
    # ln -s /bin/true /bin/update-alternatives

Installing packages without having a network connection is described [[Distrib/DebianAptOffline]].

### <a name="_Hurd_RandomDevice_Setup_random_"> </a> [[Hurd/RandomDevice]]

You often need scp and ssh. Sadly the Debian GNU/Hurd does not come with any default random package installed. See [[Hurd/RandomDevice]] for details, the following is just a quick recap.

    cd && mkdir tmp && cd tmp
    wget http://kilobug.free.fr/hurd/random-64.tar.gz
    tar xvfz random-64.tar.gz
    cp random /hurd/

    settrans -c /dev/random /hurd/random \
               --seed-file /var/run/random-seed --secure
    settrans -c /dev/urandom /hurd/random \
               --seed-file /var/run/urandom-seed --fast
    chmod 0644 /dev/random /dev/urandom

    apt-get install ssh

### <a name="_Hurd_HurdConsole_Setup_Virtual_"> </a> [[Hurd/HurdConsole]]

The latest Hurd package in Debian, plus the /native-install script, creates all necessary device nodes and other magic. You just need to edit /etc/default/hurd-console to tune the parameters and tell it to start at bootup.

You can also call the Hurd console manually with the proper arguments:

    console -d vga -d pc_kbd --repeat=kbd -d pc_mouse --repeat=mouse \
            -d generic_speaker -c /dev/vcs

    cd /dev
    ln -s cons/kbd .
    ln -s cons/mouse .

### <a name="_Hurd_DebianXorg_Setup_X_Window_"> </a> [[Hurd/DebianXorg]]

You first must have setup the virtual console. See above.

Assuming you've installed WindowMaker and have tried running startx already:

    [/etc/X11/XF86Config-4]

    Section "Module"
    #        Load           "dri"
    #        Load           "speedo"
             .
             .
             .
    EndSection

    Section "InputDevice"
            Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
            Driver          "mouse"
            Option          "CorePointer"
            Option          "Device"                "/dev/mouse"
            Option          "Protocol"              "osmouse"
    EndSection

Make sure not to have the "Emulate3Buttons" and "ZAxisMapping" settings set, as they lead to problems with e.g. dragging windows around.

    [/etc/profile]
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/X11R6/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

### <a name="What_about_package_XYZ_"> </a> What about package XYZ?

See if you can find a useful tip in [[PackageTroubleshooting]].

How about making an afterinstall man page � la !OpenBSD afterboot man page? Anyone could easily convert the current text into an afterinstall.8 page. If nobody else feels up to it I could do it.
