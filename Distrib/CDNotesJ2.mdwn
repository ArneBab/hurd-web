Here's a place for notes and sharing info about peculiarities with this set of CDs.

This CD set is based on the [[TarballNotes20020816]]

This means it uses GNU Mach 1.3. (I think, even though it says 1.2?)

This set is the third in the series to use a libio-enabled libc. This is the first set to use the newer Hurd &amp; libc, which means you don't need to manually upgrade them after installing with this CD set.
