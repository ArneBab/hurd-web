[Bochs](http://bochs.sf.net) is a very cool emulator, similar to Plex86 and the commercial product [[VmWare]] which virtualizes the PC hardware. However, Bochs does not virtualize, it _emulates_ the IA32 on the instruction level. It's currently the best alternative if you want to take the Hurd for a quick test drive without needing to repartition your hard drive or read complicated installation manuals.

* [Debian package](http://packages.qa.debian.org/bochs)

Note that Bochs is quite slow, so installing GNU inside its virtual machine will probably take you a lot of time. There are several pre-installed bochs images available.

* The Bochs project hosts a [preinstalled GNU image](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12580). It has network, Xfree86 and the console server installed and configured (X has some problems though). If you want to try it out, please read the [[BochsFAQ]] for setting up a GNU guest first.
* [Another 2GB image](http://www.gnuhurd.org/) distributed in rar format without apologies.
* Bee has a [bochs version](http://bee.es.gnu.org/) of it's distribution
