[Bochs](http://bochs.sf.net) is so cool ([Debian package](http://packages.debian.org/bochs)). It's currently the best alternative for running GNU.

Note that Bochs is quite slow and installing GNU in it will probably take you a lot of time. The Bochs project hosts a [preinstalled GNU image](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12580) which can save you a lot of time.

That GNU image has network, Xfree86 and the console server installed and configured (X has some problems though). If you want to try it out, please read the [[BochsFAQ]] for GNU guest first.
