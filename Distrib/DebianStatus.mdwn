A list of requirements for release as an official port have evolved with discussions with AJ Towns, Debian's Release Manager. The requirements include:

* 85% of the archive built
* functioning and integrated <http://buildd.debian.org> machine
* testing participation
* native compile everything
* port of new [installer](http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/)
* a firewall as part of the core OS.

The Debian [weekly news](http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2004/07/) had an item on this with an [email reference](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/debian-devel-200402/msg00615.html), but not much is said about non-Linux ports such as the Hurd, BSDs, etc.
