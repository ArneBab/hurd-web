_Main features. The 2GB partition limit has gone. The tests were made on a 20 GB partition. The 2+ years old mkfs in the GNU/Linux installation system creates the filesystem on the large partitions nicely. This means that the Linux installer has not had to be modified and so remains at "K"._

_GNU Nano is broken and so nano-tiny has replaced it in baseGNU and the tarball, so remember the "-tiny" bit when invoking the editor._
