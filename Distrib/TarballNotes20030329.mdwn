This is a new kind of tarball. While the old tarballs were used specifically to bootstrap systems manually, this particular tarball is built by Phil to fit the needs of the Debian "boot floppy" system used by the CD Images that Phil creates to help install Debian GNU/Hurd systems. This particular 20030329 tarball corresponds to the [[CDNotesK3]] set of CDs. The file MUST be named baseGNU.tgz and the file timestamp and size should help differentiate between different versions of this file.
