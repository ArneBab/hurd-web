Noted in the Debian [weekly news](http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2002/46/), here's the home page for new new Debian installer efforts. Plans are to have a Beta version available by January 2003.

<http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/>

## <a name="History"> History </a>

The current installer for the CD distribution is based on the current Debian Woody installer. It's hacked a little bit to make it work for the Hurd. Since Debian wants to move to a new installer it makes sense to track the progress so we don't get left too far behind.

## <a name="When_to_migrate"> When to migrate </a>

When the new installer is stable and someone can take responsibility for helping adapt the new installer to work in the same capacity that the current one works.

If you are interested in this area, please post to <debian-hurd@lists.debianNOSPAM.org>.
