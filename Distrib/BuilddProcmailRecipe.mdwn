I have a simple procmail recipe that extracts the subjects of the buildd emails into a logfile. With some additional work I am sure this can be useful as input to a status system/script.

    ----- Begin Procmail recipe -----

    # appends subject to log
    :0 cWh: buildd.lock
    * ^TO_buildd-porters
    | formail -x Subject >> buildd-porters.log

    # stores raw email into a maildir folder
    :0:
    * ^TO_buildd-porters
    buildd-porters/

    ----- End Procmail recipe -----

Ideally I would like to see the results processed and posted to the twiki pages where people can comment on them (hopefully without interrupting any automated status updating).
