I've setup a preliminary front page for the Distrib web. Nothing fancy, but I think it's better to have a general idea on display rather than nothing. This is your baby Grant. :)

Where should all this stuff go?

**Notes:**

[[CDNotesHome]] no longer shows dates of releases. Is this because the spaces that are included in topic names?

Strange. Nope, the spaces in links and topic names are only visible when the wiki is presented in HTML to the user, it's a visualization plugin. The topics themselves are still searchable in the same fashion.

However, we recently had a server upgrade (woody--&gt;sarge) that may have affected the apache settings. I'll look into it and post more here later.

It is still having problems.
