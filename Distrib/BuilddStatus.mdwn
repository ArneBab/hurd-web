Please use the following space to discuss development of an automated system that accepts buildd email as input and a well-defined status page as output.

If we ignore TWiki's versioning of this file (or the "well-defined status page") we can have wget downloading a HTML version of the buildd output do some sed magic into a text file and voilï¿½!

Would that be OK?

-- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 08 Jun 2002

Aha, OK, sounds good to me. I'd like to try to get consensus on (at least) which direction to head before proceeding. Then it's the next step to get done the sed magic and building an HTML output from buildd.

I saw your posts on bug-hurd about this. Adding comments on each package would be a grgeat benefit, but would perhaps require some kind of automatic merging of the comments and new buildd outputs. Which could get messy, even for an avid sed /perl/awk/python/whatever-fu master.

One idea around this could be to decouple the comments from the buildd output. Having a separate Wiki page for each package. Perhaps like this:

     Log for failed build of grub-client_0.3.0-3 (dist=unstable)            BuilddGrubClientComments
     Log for failed build of libapache-mod-auth-mysql_3.2-1 (dist=unstable) BuilddLibApacheModAuthMysqlComments

... or similar. One could even add simple markup to color failed packages red and successful builds green. The biggest issue, however, is the one dealing with commenting buildd results and merging new buildd results with these comments.

-- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 10 Jun 2002

It looks like you need no explicit merging if you just put a [[WikiWord]] for the packge in the end of buildd log line.

But if you meant merging new results with old results I know only two ways:

* Put it all in a hash in memory and update from new log
* Store it in a database and update from the log

For this you need

1. parse buildd log to get date, package name, status
2. either save into database or append to a text file
3. process the updated database/text file

Sounds easy to me. What am I missing?

Here's a related page I created awhile ago to sort out the parts of the build process and what's involved. [[GNUDebianBuildProcess]] It's just a scratchpad for myself right now, but comments are encouraged.
