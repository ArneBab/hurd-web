Please use the following space to discuss development of an automated system that accepts buildd email as input and a well-defined status page as output.

If we ignore TWiki's versioning of this file (or the "well-defined status page") we can have wget downloading a HTML version of the buildd output do some sed magic into a text file and voilï¿½!

Would that be OK?

Aha, OK, sounds good to me. I'd like to try to get consensus on (at least) which direction to head before proceeding. Then it's the next step to get done the sed magic and building an HTML output from buildd.
