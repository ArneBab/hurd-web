# <a name="Gnu_OS"> Gnu OS </a>

It is our wish/goal to establish a new direction with regards to a GNU System distribution. To that end we have established this wiki page to begin setting some direction. This was spawned from several discussions over the last few days in the Hurd mailing lists and IRC.

This is not intended to detract from Debian GNU/Hurd and we should help them where we can.

I really want this to be more of a community driven effort in the spirit of say Ubuntu. We all have different motivations and skill levels but we need a common goal to get this system going.

These are just some quick notes I am making late at night. Lets clean this up.

## <a name="What_is_driving_this_"> What is driving this? </a>

1. There is a possibility that Debian drops support for GNU/Hurd.
2. Other GNU/Linux based distros do not support the Hurd infrastructure well.
3. Freedom.

## <a name="Where_do_we_start_"> Where do we start? </a>

1. Lets establish some ground rules.
2. We need a name:
  * Just GNU is confusing, because it means too many different things to people (project for creating free software, set of tools, philosophy, license etc.). We need a distinctive name for the GNU distribution
  * "GnuOS = GNU Now Unified" has been suggested by Anders
  * "GNU System" is already somewhat established and quite descriptive; but we need some more handy short form, like GNUsys or GnuSys or something
3. We need infrastructure
  * Wiki for community communication
  * Repository for packages
    * Probably we can host it on the GNU servers
  * Mailing lists?
    * gnu-system-discuss is already there and should be used for most technical stuff
    * We might want some less formal channel for community stuff etc. in addition
    * I disagree for now. GSD is small and splitting the traffic into 2 lists, is just silly at this point. -andrew
  * IRC channel?
    * As this is closely related to the Hurd, probably we shoud just use the established #hug and ##hurd
  * Bug / Issue tracking
    * Probably we should set up a Savannah project
  * How to handle experimental patches to the core packages (Hurd, Mach, libc etc.) that are not in official CVS yet?
4. We need a community vision and direction.
  * Lets work together for a common goal
  * Lets establish goals and priorities and get resources on them. (More later)
    * Major goal to create a system making full use of Hurd features?
      * We should never hesitate to throw away existing stuff whenever it hinders us to make good use of Hurd features
      * However, we should try to reuse existing stuff (from Debian for example) as long as it doesn't limit our possibilities or impose considerable overhead
  * Lets have fun. It's GNU and it's important but let's enjoy ourselves.

## <a name="What_are_we_missing_"> What are we missing? </a>

1. Tools
  * RPC Trace
2. Installer
  * Native installer would be preferred but we can bootstrap GNU/Linux for now if necessary
3. Package Management
  * There is a proposal to use stowfs. Let's get this going and test it out. Can it be made to work? How long will it take?
