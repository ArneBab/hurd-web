Gnu OS

It is our wish/goal to establish a new direction with regards to a GNU System distribution. To that end we have established this wiki page to begin setting some direction. This was spawned from several discussions over the last few days in the #hug mailing lists.

These are just some quick notes I am making late at night. Lets clean this up.

<br />What is driving this? <br />1\. There is a possibility that Debian drops support for GNU/Hurd. <br />2\. Other GNU/Linux based distros do not support the Hurd infrastructure well. <br />3\. Freedom. <br /><br />Where do we start? <br />1\. Lets establish some ground rules. <br />2\. We need a name: - "GnuOS = GNU Now Unified" has been suggested by Anders and I like it but we are open to suggestion. <br />3\. We need infrastructure <br /> - Wiki for community communication <br /> - Repository for packages <br /> - Mailing lists? <br /> - IRC channel? <br /> - Bug tracking system <br />4\. We need a community vision and direction. <br /> - Lets work together for a common goal <br /> - Lets establish goals and priorities and get resources on them. (More later) <br /> - Lets have fun. It's GNU and it's important but let's enjoy ourselves.
