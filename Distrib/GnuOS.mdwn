# <a name="Gnu_OS"> Gnu OS </a>

It is our wish/goal to establish a new direction with regards to a GNU System distribution. To that end we have established this wiki page to begin setting some direction. This was spawned from several discussions over the last few days in the Hurd mailing lists and IRC.

These are just some quick notes I am making late at night. Lets clean this up.

## <a name="What_is_driving_this_"> What is driving this? </a>

1. There is a possibility that Debian drops support for GNU/Hurd.
2. Other GNU/Linux based distros do not support the Hurd infrastructure well.
3. Freedom.

## <a name="Where_do_we_start_"> Where do we start? </a>

1. Lets establish some ground rules.
2. We need a name:
  * "GnuOS = GNU Now Unified" has been suggested by Anders and I like it but we are open to suggestion.
3. We need infrastructure
  * Wiki for community communication
  * Repository for packages
  * Mailing lists?
  * IRC channel?
  * Bug tracking system
4. We need a community vision and direction.
  * Lets work together for a common goal
  * Lets establish goals and priorities and get resources on them. (More later)
  * Lets have fun. It's GNU and it's important but let's enjoy ourselves.
