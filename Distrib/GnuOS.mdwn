# <a name="Gnu_OS"> Gnu OS </a>

It is our wish/goal to establish a new direction with regards to a GNU System distribution. To that end we have established this wiki page to begin setting some direction. This was spawned from several discussions over the last few days in the Hurd mailing lists and IRC.

This is not intended to detract from Debian GNU/Hurd and we should help them where we can.

I really want this to be more of a community driven effort in the spirit of say Ubuntu. We all have different motivations and skill levels but we need a common goal to get this system going.

These are just some quick notes I am making late at night. Lets clean this up.

## <a name="What_is_driving_this_"> What is driving this? </a>

1. There is a possibility that Debian drops support for GNU/Hurd.
2. Other GNU/Linux based distros do not support the Hurd infrastructure well.
3. Freedom.

## <a name="Where_do_we_start_"> Where do we start? </a>

1. Lets establish some ground rules.
2. We need a name:
  * "GnuOS = GNU Now Unified" has been suggested by Anders and I like it but we are open to suggestion.
  * GNU should be the name of the system. Any other name would represent a fork of the GNU project. Atleast, that is how I see it. -Andrew
3. We need infrastructure
  * Wiki for community communication
  * Repository for packages
  * Mailing lists? Can gnu-system-discuss not be used for this purpose? -Andrew
  * IRC channel?
  * Bug tracking system
  * Issue tracking? Should we set up a Savannah project?
  * Would we fork Mach?
4. We need a community vision and direction.
  * Lets work together for a common goal
  * Lets establish goals and priorities and get resources on them. (More later)
  * Lets have fun. It's GNU and it's important but let's enjoy ourselves.

## <a name="What_are_we_missing_"> What are we missing? </a>

1. Tools
  * RPC Trace
2. Installer
  * Native installer would be preferred but we can bootstrap GNU/Linux for now if necessary
3. Package Management
  * There is a proposal to use stowfs. Let's get this going and test it out. Can it be made to work? How long will it take?
