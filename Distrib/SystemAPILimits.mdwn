## <a name="API_Limitations_of_the_GNU_syste"> </a> API Limitations of the GNU system

----

Sometimes building or running a program will fail due to bugs in the system API implementation (in Glibc and the Hurd). Make sure you check this list and know them before porting, otherwise you'll end up debugging something just to find out its an already known bug.

Taken from the bug lists in debian BTS. If you find more of them (and it is clear in the bug log that it is a bug), please add them to the list below. See:

These are the known system API limits that have porting implications.

    #190732: hurd: non-priviledged user may crash filesystem
      breaks: coreutils
      error: mv command crashes fs (Computer bought the farm)

    #47998: msgget IPC not implemented

    #184344: extern inlines in libpthread are not ansi compliant
      breaks: xfree86 (when compiled with pthreads)
      error: "gcc -ansi" gets parse error with "inline"
      status: patch sent

    #177486: POSIX semaphore
      breaks: gnome-libs?
      error: missing <semaphore.h>
      status: patch sent (but looks like it needs more work)

    #184565: libc0.3: missing shm* functions (from <sys/shm.h>)
      breaks: cdrtools
      error: warning: shm* is not implemented and will always fail

    #184573: missing res_search in -lresolv
      breaks: krb5
      status: actualy this should be in PortingIssues (see bug log)

    #190581: nice() doesn't work
      breaks: coreutils
      error: nice() doesn't take effect on some situations

    #171022: libc0.3: missing tmpfile64 function
      breaks: python2.2
      error: linker can't find "tmpfile64". this can be manifested
             in code that calls "tmpfile" when `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64'
      status: pending upload

    #187391: libc0.3-dev: sockaddr_un.sun_path can't be assigned a "const char *" when compiling with g++
      breaks: fam, gail
      status: maybe this should be in PortingIssues (see _long_ bug log)

    #190367: libc0.3-dev: fcntl F_GETLK not implemented (ENOSYS)
      breaks: gnome-session (and others) from running
      error: misc lock-related errors
