Unfortunately gcc-3.2\_3.2.3 gives "Internal error" while compiling the Hurd. You have to use gcc-3.3 but keep in mind that only CVS snapshots after 2003-05-08 can be compiled by gcc-3.3.

The K3 images are being uploaded at the moment. There has been a name change from hurd-Kx-CDy.iso to GNU-Kx-CDy.iso, but they still will be found under ../iso/hurd-K3/.. at ftp.gnu.org at just before mindnight30 April. This set is the best of the Kx series. There are four CDs.
