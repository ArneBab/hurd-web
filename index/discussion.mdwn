# TODO

Please add your comments here about what you think needs to be done on the wiki.


## What to Add

    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: so, first plan: don't mention www.d.o/ports/hurd on the wiki
    <azeem-uni> but transfer that information to the wiki, and keep it uptodate there
    <azeem-uni> and proabably make links to that on w.d.o


    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: also a top-level "How can I help Hurd development" paragraph would be nice


we have how to set-up Hurd consoles and how to set up Xorg in Hurd but we do not have any
general after-installation problems page e.g. networking problem, upgrade problem. later 
with that information we can make a page named: Technical FAQs.  -- [[arnuld]]


## How to Rearrange

I think that a bunch of pages should be shuffeled around.  For example the
mailing list or irc pages don't belong into the [[Hurd]] hierarchy.  They
should simply be top-level pages in my opinion.  -- [[tschwinge]]


[[Main]] and [[Distrib]] are messy conglomeration of everything and should be
cleaned and re-ordered.  -- [[tschwinge]]


[[Mig]] and [[Mach]] could get united into one thing.  Perhaps just alongside
with [[Hurd]] as well?  -- [[tschwinge]]


What to do with [[GNU]]?  -- [[tschwinge]]


Someone could work on getting us some nice style-sheets; see [[local.css]].  --
