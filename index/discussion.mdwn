Please add your comments here about what you think needs to be done on the wiki.

    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: so, first plan: don't mention www.d.o/ports/hurd on the wiki
    <azeem-uni> but transfer that information to the wiki, and keep it uptodate there
    <azeem-uni> and proabably make links to that on w.d.o


    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: also a top-level "How can I help Hurd development" paragraph would be nice

> [[Main]] and [[Distrib]] are messy conglomeration of everything and should be

> [[Mig]] and [[Mach]] could get united into one thing.  Perhaps just alongside

> What to do with [[GNU]]?  -- [[tschwinge]]
