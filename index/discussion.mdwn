    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: so, first plan: don't mention www.d.o/ports/hurd on the wiki
    <azeem-uni> but transfer that information to the wiki, and keep it uptodate there
    <azeem-uni> and proabably make links to that on w.d.o

    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: also a top-level "How can I help Hurd development" paragraph would be nice
