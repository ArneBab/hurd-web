# TODO

Please add your comments here about what you think needs to be done on these
web pages.


## What to Add

I would like to see the contributions page modified to include hardware needed, documentation wanted etc Much like the OpenBSD project has done http://www.openbsd.org/want.html --gregory

    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: so, first plan: don't mention www.d.o/ports/hurd on the wiki
    <azeem-uni> but transfer that information to the wiki, and keep it uptodate there
    <azeem-uni> and proabably make links to that on w.d.o


## How to Rearrange

[[Hurd]] and [[Distrib]] are a messy conglomeration of everything and should be
cleaned and re-ordered.  --[[tschwinge]]
