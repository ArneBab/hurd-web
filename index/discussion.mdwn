# TODO

Please add your comments here about what you think needs to be done on the wiki.


## What to Add

    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: so, first plan: don't mention www.d.o/ports/hurd on the wiki
    <azeem-uni> but transfer that information to the wiki, and keep it uptodate there
    <azeem-uni> and proabably make links to that on w.d.o


    <azeem-uni> tschwinge: also a top-level "How can I help Hurd development" paragraph would be nice


we have "how to set-up Hurd consoles" and "how to set up Xorg in Hurd" but we do not have any
general after-installation problems page e.g. networking problem, upgrade problem. later 
with that information we can make a page named: Technical FAQs.  --[[arnuld]]


## How to Rearrange

[[Hurd]] and [[Distrib]] are a messy conglomeration of everything and should be
cleaned and re-ordered.  --[[tschwinge]]


The three of [[Xfree86]], [[DebianX]], [[DebianXorg]] should be merged into
one.


    <azeem> tschwinge: maybe we should discuss wiki page naming policies WRT Debian
    <azeem> I'd rather have something like /Debian, /DebianInstall, /DebianFAQ, /DebianInstallCrosshurd etc.
    <azeem> than the current distrib


What to do with [[GNU]]?  --[[tschwinge]]


Someone could work on getting us some nice style-sheets; see [[local.css]].
