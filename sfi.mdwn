SFI stands for Software-Based Fault Isolation.  SFI is an [[isolation]]
technique described by Wahbe et al. in their 1993 paper [Effcient
Software-Based Fault Isolation](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/wahbe93efficient.html).
Instead of running code is a separate process, untrusted code
is loaded into into the host's address space, part of the address
space is reserved to the application and referred to as its fault
domain, and the code is rewritten such that it cannot modify or jump
to addresses outside of its fault domain.
