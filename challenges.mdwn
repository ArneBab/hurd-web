The GNU Hurd has a lot of [[advantages]], but there are challenges, too.

Some of these are explained in the [[hurd/critique]].

Even though they're quite popular in the simpler embedded space, there is no
successful true multi-server [[microkernel]] system for general-purpose desktop
use yet.  This is still an ongoing research effort.  (TODO: add references.)

Likewise, resource scheduling in distributed operating system kernels is a
research topic.  For example, read more about it on the relevant [[Open Issues
page|service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663/multiprocessing]].  Also, the [[microkernel/Viengoos]]
research kernel project strives to explore these.

TODO: more to come.  [[!tag open_issue_documentation]]
