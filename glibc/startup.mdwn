Be it statically or dynamically linked, the *startup* of glibc-based programs
is quite hairy on GNU Hurd systems.

    <youpi> braunr: btw, after patching glibc and trying installing it, do you
      try rebuilding hurd against it? ext2fs.static often breaks due to details
    <braunr> youpi: yes
    <braunr> youpi: always
    <youpi> ok, good :)
    <braunr> i want the rootfs to benefit from it too :)
    <youpi> heh :)
    <braunr> and yes, there were issues that occurred only in the rootfs
    <braunr> but because of the special early state, not because of static
      linking
