*[[UNIX]] signals* are a means to asynchronously invoke a specific function
(*signal handler*).  This may impact on [[system call]]s that are executing at
the same time in that they may be completely aborted, return incomplete
results, scheduled for restarting, or cause signal delivery to be blocked upon
the system call's completion.

An explanation can be found in the relevant standards, an overview, including
UNIX signals' deficiencies is given in {{$unix#2010_brown_ghosts_3}}, for
example.

The UNIX signalling mechanism is implemented for the GNU Hurd by means of a
separate signal-handling thread that is part of every process.  This makes
handling of signals a separate thread of control.
