    <civodul> youpi: local-tls-support.diff removes libc-tsd.h; what's the
      rationale?
    <youpi> it's completely replaced by __thread variables
    <civodul> ok, but apparently there are still libc headers that #include it
    <civodul> like malloc-machine.h
    <youpi> they'll include bits/libc-tsd.h instead
    <civodul> oh, ok
