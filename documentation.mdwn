You are interested in getting familiar with the GNU/Hurd system architecture,
or specific components of it?  Here is a collection of texts to read.

/!\ A lot of stuff is still missing ([[!taglink open_issue_documentation]]).

# Basic Knowledge

Before you can go details, you have to learn the basics about operating system
architecture.  Yes, really.


## Operating Systems Basics

Books.  Etc.


## GNU/Hurd System Architecture


### Capabilities

{{$capability#shapiro_capintro_1999}}.

  * Our use of [[capabilities|capability]].  The
    {{$capability#wikipedia_capability-based_security}} article.
    Alternatively/additionally, [[!toggle id=shapiro_capintro_1999
    text="[shapiro\_capintro\_1999]"]].

    In the GNU/Hurd system, a [[capability]] is represented by a [[Mach
    port|microkernel/mach/port]].

  * {{$capability#wikipedia_object-capability_model}}.  Albeit not directly
    tailored at the GNU/Hurd operating system architecture, this artice anyway
    does a good job at describing general principles of a [[capability]]-based
    system architecture.
