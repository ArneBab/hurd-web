To request an account on the *bddebian* machines either contact
*bddebian* or *tschwinge* (other people might also be able to help) in [[IRC]]
or send email to <hurd-shell-account@gnu.org>.  Also use these contact
addresses for requesting support with respect to software installations, etc.


For easy access, you should append your public SSH key(s)
to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine.

Also, add the following stanza to `~/.ssh/config` of the machine you're
connecting from:

    Host blubber.bddebian.com blubber
      HostName blubber.bddebian.com
    
    Host clubber.bddebian.com clubber
      HostName clubber.bddebian.com
      Port 2251
    
    Host flubber.bddebian.com flubber
      HostName flubber.bddebian.com
      Port 2250
    
    Host foobar.bddebian.com foobar
      HostName foobar.bddebian.com
    
    Host gnubber.bddebian.com gnubber
      HostName gnubber.bddebian.com
      Port 2254
    
    Host goober.bddebian.com goober
      HostName goober.bddebian.com
      Port 2255
    
    Host zenhost.bddebian.com zenhost
      HostName zenhost.bddebian.com
      Port 2260
    
    Host blubber.bddebian.com blubber foobar.bddebian.com foobar
      ProxyCommand ssh zenhost socat - TCP4:%h:%p
    
    Host *.bddebian.com blubber clubber flubber foobar gnubber goober zenhost
      CheckHostIP no
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      User [username]

The `CheckHostIP` statement is for not having to worry about the machines's IP
addresses changing (due to dial-up connection), and the `UserKnownHostsFile`
one together with the `StrictHostKeyChecking` one are for not having ot worry
about the host keys changing (when the machines are re-installed).  Of course,
this undermines SSH's security system, so you may disagree about these.
