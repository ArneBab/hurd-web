There are GNU/Hurd boxes that we're offering shell accounts on.  These are
generally available for everyone interested in [[contributing]], or just having
a look at a GNU/Hurd system.

An alternative to online shell access may be using a [[QEMU
image|hurd/running/qemu]].

If you are a Debian Developer, you can log into the exodar or strauss machines
with your DD account, your public ssh keys are already there.  To request a
non-DD account on them, please contact admin@{exodar,strauss}.debian.net, with
your Alioth account name and a public ssh key.

To request an account on the *[[bddebian]]* or *[[sceen]]* machines, please
contact <hurd-shell-account@gnu.org> (don't forget to include your desired user
name and public SSH key).  Also use that contact address for requesting
support, such as get additional packages installed.

For easy access, you should append your public SSH key(s)
to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine.

Also, add the following stanza to the `~/.ssh/config` file of the machine
you're connecting from.
