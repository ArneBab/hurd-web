Here are some Hurd boxes that users have made available to the public:

To request an account on the `*.bddebian.com` machines either contact
*bddebian* or *tschwinge* (other people might also be able to help) in [[IRC]]
or send email to <hurd-shell-account@gnu.org>.  Also use these contact
addresses for requesting support with respect to software installations, etc.

For the `hurd.nipl.net` host, please see <http://www.nipl.net/>.

To be able to use just `ssh [machine]`, you should append your public SSH key
to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine.

And if you don't want to worry about the machines's IP addresses changing (due
to dial-up connection) or the host keys changing every now and then (when the
machines are re-installed), put something like the following into
`~/.ssh/config` of the machine you connect from:

    Host clubber.bddebian.com clubber
      HostName clubber.bddebian.com
      Port 2251
    
    Host flubber.bddebian.com flubber
      HostName flubber.bddebian.com
      Port 2250
    
    Host gnubber.bddebian.com gnubber
      HostName gnubber.bddebian.com
      Port 2254
    
    Host goober.bddebian.com goober
      HostName goober.bddebian.com
      Port 2255
    
    Host *.bddebian.com clubber flubber gnubber goober
      CheckHostIP no
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
