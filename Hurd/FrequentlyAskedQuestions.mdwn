In addition to the [general FAQ](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/docs.html#TOCfaq) there are the following typical newbie questions. (There is an [updated version](http://tuxou.ouvaton.org/hurd/) which is not official yet.)

If you still have problems, do not hesitate to make use of the [[MailingLists]] or the [[IRC]].

* **_You say GNU, don't you mean GNU/Hurd?_**
  * Yes and no. GNU refers to the system as a whole, while GNU/Hurd is more specific, saying that it is the GNU system running on the Hurd -- to differentiate it from the GNU system running on Linux, GNU/Linux. Also see [[GNU/GnuNames]]

* **_What editor can I use?_**
  * `nano` is the default editor on a fresh install, not `ae`.

* **_Why can't I get the answers I need from Hurd hackers?_**
  * This [document](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) may help you understand some developers attitudes and social norms.

* **_Where are the virtual consoles I use when running GNU/Linux?_**
  * You need to [use screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q4-6) instead, also available when running GNU/Linux.
  * The [new console](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2002/debian-hurd-200209/msg00054.html) by Marcus Brinkmann could also be used. It supports the Alt-Fn keys for switching like in GNU/Linux. NOTE: that message has an error in the configuration steps, it says `/dev/vts` when it means `/dev/vcs`. A more up-to-date howto is [[HurdConsole]].

* **_What is a translator?_**
  * The official FAQ [answers](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q4-2) this question by a reference to [hurd-doc-translator](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-translator).

* **_Where's the sauce?_**
  * It's on [Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org). See also the [GNU Development Resources](http://www.gnu.org/software/devel.html), for more information.

* **_What is this "libio" stuff?_**
  * There was an ABI change for glibc0.3. It's recommended you reinstall your GNU/Hurd system if you run a system installed before the summer of 2002. This is a similar cause for the various Linux distributions who changed from libc5 to libc6 or glibc2 around 1998.

* **_What is GNU Mach vs. oskit-mach?_**
  * These are different versions of the Mach microkernel that supports the Hurd that runs on top of it. For more info, see [[Mach]]

* **_What software is available for GNU?_**
  * Most packages from [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) [GNU/Linux](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) which aren't linux-specific ([Packages That Won't Be Ported](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-devel-debian)) are expected to work on GNU/Hurd too. See the database in <http://packages.debian.org/>. Programs which need pthreads, including [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org), [KDE](http://www.kde.org), [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org), [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org), [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org), etc. are being worked on currently using Neal Walfields libpthreads. See the [[Distrib/PortingIssues]] document for some common build problems and their solutions.
  * If you can't fetch a package with "apt-get install ", try building it from source: "apt-get source  &amp;&amp; cd &lt;package\_dir&gt; &amp;&amp; debian/rules binary".
  * As of January 2007, 50% of Debian packages have been ported on the Hurd. Of course, bug testing is welcome.

* **_How do I initialize a serial console on the Hurd?_**
  * You can try out the Serial Howto at <http://www.nongnu.org/thug/serial-howto.txt>
  * For a real serial console at boot time you need to rebuild your GNUmach 1.x kernel. For more info see the Utah release notes at [http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/mach4-i386/html/mach4-UK22.html#serial\_console](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/mach4-i386/html/mach4-UK22.html#serial_console)

* **_Will GNU work in Vmware?_**
  * It's highly recommended and easier to get a full image for Bochs. See [[Distrib]]
  * It didn't use to, [Hurd bootstrap fails](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2002/debian-hurd-200207/msg00069.html). Vmware is not [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and it is [[Distrib/VmWare]]. We recommend to use [free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) alternatives, like [[Distrib/BochsEmulator]].
  * A faster, more widespread and [free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) recent alternative is [QEMU](http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Distrib/QEMU). You can find more informations on [[Distrib/HurdOnQEMU]].
  * If someone prefers using VMWare:
    * It works with VMWare Workstation 4.0.5 build-6030.
    * Running Debian GNU/HURD in VMWare works for me -- [[Main/MichaelAblassmeier]] - 03 Mar 2004
