#### <a name="Table_Of_Contents"> Table Of Contents </a>

This is a brief helper on how to setup Xorg on Debian GNU/Hurd.

Obviously this text is taken from the page <http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Hurd/DebianX> but I was making such drastic changes, I didn't want to hack up that page.

### <a name="Mouse_amp_Keyboard"> Mouse &amp; Keyboard </a>

See [[HurdConsole]] for more details.

You should instruct the Hurd console to repeat keyboard events to `/dev/cons/kbd`, and mouse events to `/dev/cons/mouse`:

    # console -d vga -d pc_kbd --repeat=kbd -d generic_speaker \
      -d pc_mouse --repeat=mouse --protocol=ps/2 -c /dev/vcs

Symbolic links to repeaters should also be created:

    # ln -s /dev/cons/kbd /dev/kbd
    # ln -s /dev/cons/mouse /dev/mouse

**BDd: Is this already done in the Debian package?**

### <a name="Selecting_amp_Configuring_Packag"> Selecting &amp; Configuring Packages </a>

BDd: You currently need to pull the xserver-xorg package from <http://dept-info.labri.fr/~thibault/debian-hurd/>.

The `x-window-system-core` package brings you most of what you need for a base, plus you need to choose a window manager:

* WindowMaker, `wmaker`
* FVWM, `fvwm`
* Blackbox, `blackbox`
* TWM, `twm`

I know that Window Maker works, however, I cannot attest to the others. xfce4 is currently broken.

The recommended way of configuring X is using the `xserver-xorg` debconf template, eg:

    # dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

This currently seems to be broken in the Debian package so it may be easier to just copy a working configuration from another operating system on the same computer and place it in `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`. You need to edit the mouse settings by hand according to the below example, though.

**_IMPORTANT:_** when you configure X, make sure you do **NOT** enable the `speedo` and `dri` modules because they are currently broken.

**BDd: I cannot attest to this currently.**

### <a name="Edit_xorg_conf"> Edit xorg.conf </a>

Here is an example of my xorg.conf:

    # /etc/X11/xorg.conf (xorg X Window System server configuration file)
    #
    # This file was generated by dexconf, the Debian X Configuration tool, using
    # values from the debconf database.
    #
    # Edit this file with caution, and see the /etc/X11/xorg.conf manual page.
    # (Type "man /etc/X11/xorg.conf" at the shell prompt.)
    #
    # This file is automatically updated on xserver-xorg package upgrades *only*
    # if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of the xserver-xorg
    # package.
    #
    # If you have edited this file but would like it to be automatically updated
    # again, run the following command:
    #   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg

### <a name="Starting_X"> Starting X </a>

Finally, run `startx`

However, there are several caveats to be aware of:

* `xterm` does not work correctly; try `rxvt`.

**_UPDATE 3/2/2006_**: xterm works fine for me from youpi's repo (See link above).

* `update-menu` does not yet work. As such, there are no fine Debian menus.
* GNOME can now be ported with the new pthreads, but is still being worked on. Window Maker, TWM, Blackbox and FVWM all work.

**_WARNING:_** If you get an error about opening the display or a permissions issue, you may need to run the following:

    # dpkg-reconfigure xserver-common

change from "Console Users Only" to "Anybody"

Good luck and enjoy!
