1. First, set up the keyboard translator:

    # cd /dev
    # ./MAKEDEV kbd

1. And then the mouse translator. For a serial port mouse, this is along the lines of:

    # settrans /dev/mouse /hurd/mouse --device=com0 --protocol=microsoft

Make sure that `/dev/com0` actually exists. If it does not, create it using `MAKEDEV` in the usual fashion.

PS/2 so not require a device. It is simple a matter of:

    # settrans /dev/mouse /hurd/mouse --protocol=ps/2

For other mice, run `/hurd/mouse` with the `--help` option.

1. You will need several X packages. The `x-window-system-core` package will bring you most of what you need: `xserver-xfree86`, `xfonts-base`, `xfonts-100dpi`, `xfonts-75dpi`, `xfonts-scalable`, `xbase-clients`, `xutils`, `rxvt`, your window manager of choice

1. The recommended way of configuring X is using the `xserver-xfree86` debconf template, eg: `dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86`. It may just be easiest to just copy a working configuration file from another operation system running on the same computer and place it in `/etc/X11/XF86Config-4`, but this is discouraged as you'd have to remove some sections by hand.

IMPORTANT: when you configure it, make sure you DON'T enable the following modules: `speedo`, `dri` because they're currently broken.

Then, edit the file manualy and make the mouse sections look like this:

    Section "InputDevice"
            Identifier      "Configured Mouse"
            Driver          "mouse"
            Option          "CorePointer"
            Option          "Device"                "/dev/mouse"
            Option          "Protocol"              "osmouse"
    EndSection

    Section "InputDevice"
            Identifier      "Generic Mouse"
            Driver          "mouse"
            Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
            Option          "Device"                "/dev/mouse"
            Option          "Protocol"              "osmouse"
    EndSection

Emulate3Buttons (`Option "Emulate3Buttons" "true"`) may be optionally added. Nothing else will work.

1. As the Hurd does not use `ld.so.conf`, it is necessary to add the following to `/etc/profile` to be sure that the libraries are found:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/X11R6/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

1. Finally, run `startx`

1. There are several caveats to be aware of:
  1. 1. `xterm` does not work correctly; try `rxvt`.
    2. `update-menu` does not yet work. As such, there are no fine Debian menus.
    3. GNOME can now be ported with the new pthreads, but is still worked on. Window Maker, TWM, Blackbox and FVWM all work.
