It would be nice if we had a bootable Hurd [LiveCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCD) like Knoppix, Morphix or Damn Small Linux. It would be useful for those who want to try out the Hurd before they commit to installing it on their hard disks. In addition to that, a bootable Hurd CD would enable us to have a native installer instead of relying on Linux.
