# <a name="The_Coyotos_microkernel"> The Coyotos microkernel </a>

[Coyotos](http://www.coyotos.org/index.html) is a microkernel and OS and the successor of EROS, that itself is the successor of KeyKOS. A more complete history can be found [here](http://www.coyotos.org/history.html). It's main objectives are to correcte some shortcomings of EROS, demonstrate that an atomic kernel design scales well and to completely formally verify both the kernel and critical system components by writing them in a new language called bitc.

Coyotos is an orthogonally persistent pure capability system. It uses continuation based unbuffered asynchronous IPC (actually it's synchronous IPC whith asynchronous syscalls).

TODO: explain these terms and (more important) their consequences on system design.

The coyotos microkernel specification can be found [here](http://www.coyotos.org/docs/ukernel/spec.html)
