The magic translator provides /dev/fd.

    $ showtrans /dev/fd
    /hurd/magic --directory fd

The /dev/fd directory holds the open file descriptors for your current process. You can't see them with \`ls -l /dev/fd/' but you can see them individually like this:

    $ ls -l /dev/fd/0
    crw--w----  1 bing tty 0, 0 Nov 19 18:00 /dev/fd/0
