# <a name="Next_Hurd"> Next Hurd </a>

There is work on progress to design a new Hurd, which started by trying to port the Hurd to the L4 ï¿½-kernel. As L4 itself is now deprecated and it's successors, L4.sec and L4ng, are not ready yet, efforts are directed toward designing from scratch this new Hurd.

There are discussions on the desired features of the new Hurd, and discussions about it's design principles and core properties.

Summaries should obey the following structure:

* if there is a consensus, it is clearly described
* if controversial points remain, there are also described after the consenus
* if no choice has been clearly made, all valid positions are descrbied
* withdrawed and invalid positions (prooved wrong, unrealistic, contradictory to some design principle, etc.) should be described only very briefly, and developed in a separate article

Each time a point seems to be overly long with respect to the rest of the article, it should be summarized in place and developed in a separate article.
