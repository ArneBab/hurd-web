No DHCP client has been ported to the Hurd yet.

[This](http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-hurd/2003-10/msg00016.html) thread on help-hurd has a little more info on what's still needed for DHCP.

Found this [message](http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2003-08/msg00045.html) about DHCP capabilities in the Hurd encouraging.

The beginnings of a DHCP translator is available in the Hurd sources on Savannah: [hurd/trans/pump.c](http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/hurd/hurd/trans/pump.c?rev=1.3&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup)

Unfortunately our current TCP/IP stack, the pfinet translator, lacks support for the AF\_PACKET interface as well as sending packets with an IP address of 0.0.0.0.

Grant Bowman on bug-hurd:

    Herbert Xu (Pump maintainer) told me that to operate correctly, pump
    uses the AF_PACKET interface which is only present in 2.2.

    Anyone else know the status of getting these compiled and functional?

Neal Walfield on bug-hurd replies:

    We need to be able to send to the DHCP server with ip address 0.0.0.0.
