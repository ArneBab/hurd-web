# Porting Applications

Debian is currently the Hurd distribution of choice among Hurd
users and devellopers.  Approximately half of the Debian archive
has been compiled successfully on the Hurd, however, many
programs fail to build for various reasons.  [Significant
packages and problems](http://alioth.debian.org/pm/?group_id=30628)
are listed there.  You can also just install the Hurd and
find what doesn't work for you and port it and then file
bugs against the package in the Debian BTS or upstream.

# Hurd Proper

If you are interested in developping the Hurd proper, there is
plenty of work todo.  Before you can significantly contribute,
take some time to learn about the system, e.g.,
[[MicroKernelsForBeginners]].  Until you can do the basic exercises
listed there, you won't be able to significantly contribute to
the Hurd.

See the [[ToDo]].

# GNU Mach

GNU Mach is the underlying microkernel used by the Hurd.  It has
a number of deficencies [[Mach/GNUMachRevivalProject]].
