In addition to the [general FAQ](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/docs.html#TOCfaq) there are the following typical newbie questions.

If you still have problems, do not hesitate to make use of the [[MailLists]] or the [[HurdIRC]].

**_Newbie questions:_**

* What editor can I use?
  * nano is the default editor, not ae.

* Why can't I get the answers I need from Hurd hackers?
  * This [document](http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) may help you understand some developers attitudes and social norms.

* Where are the virtual consoles I use when running GNU/Linux?
  * You need to [use screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q4-6) instead, also available when running GNU/Linux.

* What is a translator?
  * The FAQ [answers](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q4-2) this question by a reference to [hurd-doc-translator](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-translator).

* Where's the sauce?
  * It's on [Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org). See also the [GNU Development Resources](http://www.gnu.org/software/devel.html), for more information.

* What is this "libio" stuff?
  * There was an ABI change for glibc0.3. It's recommended you reinstall your GNU/Hurd system.

* What software is available for GNU?
  * Most packages from [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) \[[http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html]\[GNU/Linux] which aren't linux-specific (\[[http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-devel-debian]\[Packages That Won't Be Ported]) are expected to work on GNU/Hurd too. See the database in <http://packages.debian.org/>. Large exceptions are the programs which need pthreads, which include [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org), [KDE](http://www.kde.org), [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org), [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org), [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org), etc. If you can't fetch a package with "apt-get install ", try building it from source: "apt-get source  &amp;&amp; cd  &amp;&amp; debian/rules binary". See the [Porting](http://www.vmlinux.org/twiki/bin/view/Hurd/Porting) document for some common build problems and their solutions.
