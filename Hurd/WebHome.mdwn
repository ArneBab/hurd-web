**Welcome to the home of** the Hurd TWiki. It is a web-based collaboration effort for anything related to the Hurd. It was announced on [May 12, 2002](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-May/008342.html) and is growing quickly.

In our Wiki everyone is equal and shares equal rights, liberties and responsibilities. Feel free to add content, but please respect the guidelines set forth in the %TWIKIWEB%.GoodStyle rules. For content on the Hurd Wiki we would prefer that you create your own [user account](http://vmlinux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TWikiUsers) on the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiRegistration page and use that instead of a [[Main/TWikiGuest]] account (see that page for info on how to use the guest account).
