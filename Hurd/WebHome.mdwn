**Welcome to the home of** the Hurd TWiki. It is a web-based collaboration effort for anything related to the Hurd. It was announced on [May 12, 2002](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-May/008342.html) and is growing quickly.

Recently this wiki moved to its new permanent home, <http://hurd.gnufans.org>. Please update your bookmarks if you got redirected here from the old location.

In our Wiki everyone is equal and shares equal rights, liberties and responsibilities. Feel free to add content, but please respect the guidelines set forth in the %TWIKIWEB%.GoodStyle rules. For content on the Hurd Wiki we would prefer that you create your own [user account](http://vmlinux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TWikiUsers) on the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiRegistration page. You may also see [[Main/TWikiGuest]] for info on how to use the guest account.
