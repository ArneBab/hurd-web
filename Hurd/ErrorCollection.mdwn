## <a name="Error_collection_page"> Error collection page </a>

This page is intended to serve as a pasting page for error messages. If you experience an error -- specifically in a crash -- just paste it here.

Do not confuse this page with a bug tracker. In a bug tracker, you usually have to describe problems specifically, ponder about the wording, search the Internet for information, make sure you have checked other conditions, etc.; here, you just paste the error message so other people can use it as a **reference**. An entry here may lead to a bug report, however.

Feel free to comment pastings and ask questions about them..
