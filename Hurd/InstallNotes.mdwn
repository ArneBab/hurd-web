The [installation](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/install.html) page is the logical place to start. Neal Walfield's [guide](http://web.walfield.org/papers/hurd-installation-guide/english/hurd-install-guide.html) is excellent. Items not mentioned elsewhere include:

* The current system install image is located temporarily located <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/hurd/debian-staging/>

* a recommended /etc/apt/sources.list

          deb ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/hurd/debian unstable main
          deb ftp:/ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main
          deb-src ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main

* Some packages like libc6-dev are old yet depended on by other packages not yet updated. In this particular case, I believe the new dependency is libc0.3-dev. However these dependencies may cause problems for apt. To circumvent these problems there are two general solutions.
  * The first is to change the dependencies that apt looks at in the /var/lib/apt/lists/ directory. For example, you could modify libc0.3 to provide the missing libc6-dev package.
  * Installing the "equivs" package and creating a dummy package is the second alternative. This will satisfy the apt dependency in a cleaner manner.

* To install under the bochs emulator Alfred M. Szmidt wrote a [great guide](http://ftp.walfield.org/pub/people/ams/hurd/creating_bochs_image_for_gnu.txt).
