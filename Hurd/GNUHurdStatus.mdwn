Two canonical status lists are available from the CVS archive:

* [TODO file](http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/~checkout~/hurd/hurd/TODO?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain) - from Hurd repository
* [Task file](http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/~checkout~/hurd/hurd/tasks?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain) - from Hurd respository

Here are some notes taken from an [IRC discussion](http://web.walfield.org/~hird/%23hurd-200209027) September 28th, 2002. The part of the log at which I am summarizing starts with

    <marcus@18:26> wolfgang: I once made a list of things that are definitely to be done
    before a release. want me to write it here?  (It's only on paper so far)

This list is intended to apply to "just the CVS of the [Hurd itself](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/hurd)." It is specifically not intended to apply to GNU/Hurd and definately not Debian GNU/Hurd.

       * xkb driver for console (for international users)
       * kbd leds in console (well, in general, Roland's new driver in oskit for that crap)
       * fixing fakeroot (it's buggy)
       * fixing tmpfs (it's buggy, Neal says it's Mach's fault)
       * adding posix shared memory (requires the io_close call to be implemented)
       * adding posix file locking (requires the io_close call to be implemented)
       * testing
          * find + various filesystems (are inode numbers for . and .. sane?)
          * ext2fs with other block sizes than 4096
          * --help and --version and --usage in all programs
             * I have seen ^V in some --help output, might be argp bug
             * Verify that all options are documented clearly, and that
               no unimplemented options appear
             * Is the short and long description in the help output correct?
          * Is the return value of all programs correct (eg, does main() return a
            sane value)
          * Is the suid bit correctly set for all installed programs?
          * Translators
             * Does settrans -g work?  -fg?
             * Does fsysopts work?  Does setting options with fsysopts work?
             * Does stat() work on all translated nodes and give proper data?
             * What about chown, chmod (some translators should pass this
               through to the underlying node, esp in /dev!)
             * Does statfs give correct data?
             * Are all inode numbers and link counts correct?
       * [one unreadable item on the paper]
       * We also should have a "make check" test suite.  We can add this once Jeff
         finished his automake patches
       * pick up the other things
          * pthread, definitely.  Now that we are so close
          * new console is basically done
             * needs integration of course
             * X switching support
       * there is certainly more to do ...

This is the wrong place for this but I'll put it here for now. Here's an [email about pthreads direction](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/hurd-devel/2002q3/000449.html) from hurd-devel mail list.

Wolfgang also created a wonderful list of [Easy tasks](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/help-hurd/2002-July/006413.html) on July 28, 2002 that I will quote here:

    0 - Check if all programs handle options (at least --help, --version and
         --usage; don't forget about the shell scripts)
    1 - Check if all translators handle fsysopts
    1 - Check if all translators respond to "settrans -g"
    1 - More tests of this kind
    2 - Fix those of the above who don't work as intended
    2 - Document (in doc/hurd.texi) all undocumented programs (translators as
         well as programs in utils/ and sutils/ and some others)
    1 - Find a POSIX test suite, run it on GNU/Hurd, report the results
    1 - Find more useful test suites to run
    3 - Update INSTALL-cross
    2 - Check if all the store classes in libstore work (we have many of them,
         look into the Makefile)
    4 - Fix those who don't work
    2 - Document all still undocumented store classes
    2 - The console is pretty new code, it told me it wants to get tested
