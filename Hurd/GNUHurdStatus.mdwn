Here are some notes taken from an [IRC discussion](http://web.walfield.org/~hird/%23hurd-200209027) September 28th, 2002. The part of the log at which I am summarizing starts with

    <marcus@18:26> wolfgang: I once made a list of things that are definitely to be done
    before a release. want me to write it here?  (It's only on paper so far)

This list is intended to apply to "just the CVS of the [Hurd itself](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/hurd)." It is specifically not intended to apply to GNU/Hurd and definately not Debian GNU/Hurd.

       * xkb driver for console (for international users)
       * kbd leds in console (well, in general, Roland's new driver in oskit for that crap)
       * fixing fakeroot (it's buggy)
       * fixing tmpfs (it's buggy, Neal says it's Mach's fault)
       * adding posix shared memory (requires the io_close call to be implemented)
       * adding posix file locking (requires the io_close call to be implemented)
       * testing
          * find + various filesystems (are inode numbers for . and .. sane?)
          * ext2fs with other block sizes than 4096
          * --help and --version and --usage in all programs
             * I have seen ^V in some --help output, might be argp bug
             * Verify that all options are documented clearly, and that
               no unimplemented options appear
             * Is the short and long description in the help output correct?
          * Is the return value of all programs correct (eg, does main() return a
            sane value)
          * Is the suid bit correctly set for all installed programs?
          * Translators
             * Does settrans -g work?  -fg?
             * Does fsysopts work?  Does setting options with fsysopts work?
             * Does stat() work on all translated nodes and give proper data?
             * What about chown, chmod (some translators should pass this
               through to the underlying node, esp in /dev!)
             * Does statfs give correct data?
             * Are all inode numbers and link counts correct?
       * [one unreadable item on the paper]
       * We also should have a "make check" test suite.  We can add this once Jeff
         finished his automake patches
       * pick up the other things
          * pthread, definitely.  Now that we are so close
          * new console is basically done
             * needs integration of course
             * X switching support
       * there is certainly more to do ...

This is the wrong place for this but I'll put it here for now. Here's an [email about pthreads direction](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/hurd-devel/2002q3/000449.html) from hurd-devel mail list.
