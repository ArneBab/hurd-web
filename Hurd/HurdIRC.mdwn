The Hurd has its own #hurd channel hosted on [Freenode.net](http://freenode.net/). Connect to <irc://irc.freenode.net> and `/join #hurd` to begin.

**_Note:_** "Stupid" questions do not exist! We do sometimes forget that we have all learned how to use IRC. Please don't mind the louder voices on the channel if they seem a bit caustic.
