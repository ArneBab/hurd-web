# <a name="Internet_Relay_Chat"> Internet Relay Chat </a>

The Hurd has its own #hurd channel hosted on [Freenode.net](http://freenode.net) (renamed from [the Open Projects Network](http://www.openprojects.net)). Connect to <irc://irc.freenode.net> and `/join #hurd` to begin.

The main URLs for the project are <http://hurd.gnu.org> (official) and <http://hurd.gnufans.org> (this site) in that order.

**_Lingo:_** We use "Hird!" to say "Hello!" on the Hurd channels. Why is this? Because a female member of the community once made this mistake when typing "Hi" and it has stuck ever since.

**_Note:_** "Stupid" questions do not exist! We do sometimes forget that we have all learned how to use IRC. Please don't mind the louder voices on the channel if they seem a bit caustic.
