The Hurd has its own #hurd channel hosted on [Freenode.net](http://freenode.net) (renamed from [the Open Projects Network](http://www.openprojects.net)). Connect to <irc://irc.freenode.net> and `/join #hurd` to begin.

We happen to have developers in Australia, Europe, Canada and the US so we have most time zones covered most of the time. Most of the logs are [kept here](http://web.walfield.org/~hird/) and collected by the Deride bot [source code](http://ftp.walfield.org/pub/people/neal/deride/), a new LISP bot written by Neal Walfield.

**_Lingo:_** We use "Hird!" to say "Hello!" on the Hurd channels. Why is this? Because a female member of the community once made this mistake when typing "Hi" and it has stuck ever since.

**_Note:_** "Stupid" questions do not exist! We do sometimes forget that we have all learned how to use IRC. Please don't mind the louder voices on the channel if they seem a bit caustic.

* [Summary](http://bender.yi.org/hurd-bunny/)

#hurd-bunny logs are collected and hosted via a moobot run on another machine. [Old log](http://web.walfield.org/~grant/hurd-bunny-irc-stats.html) summary - logs no longer recorded using Deride.

#hurd-bunny is a place to discuss whatever you want with other people related to the Hurd project in some way. This is a social channel.

## <a name="hurd_tech"> #hurd-tech </a>

This channel started as an "overflow" channel when #hurd gets too flooded and off-topic. It is no longer available.
