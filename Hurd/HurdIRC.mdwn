While all official development takes place on the mailing lists and the Savannah trackers, 
a lot of discussions are being had on IRC as well. Everybody is welcome to join and follow these channels, but please 
respect the below guidelines if you want to participate.

# Asking Questions

If you have a question regarding the Hurd or Debian, a good forum
is often #hurd.  **However**, please follow these [guidelines](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
when asking your question.  Namely: spend some time trying
to solve the problem on your own (e.g., [search the web](http://www.google.com),
use this wiki, etc.), show us that you did so when you
ask your question, and provide as many relevant details as possible
reproducing them as exactly as possible.

# Staying On-Topic

Please try to stay on topic.

* emacs vs. vi **is not** on topic.
* If it is appropriate for a **slashdot comment**, it's not appropriate
  here.
* why GNU sucks **is off-topic**
* when the next release of the Hurd will be **is inappropriate**

# Pasting Logs

Sometimes providing a log or some other excerpt of text can
help solve a problem or answer a question.  **Do not** paste
the log in the channel itself.  Instead use a
[paste bin](http://paste.debian.net).

# Rich Text

Don't use it.  Don't use colors.  Don't use bold.  Don't use emphasis.

# Greeting

If you never contribute to the discussion, there is no need
to always greet the channel when you enter and before leave.
