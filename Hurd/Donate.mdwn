If you feel like donating goods or money for the work the developers are doing, then we're happy to confirm that this is indeed possible. Of course we'd really like to have you working with us on the system, but if you're feeling generous we won't stop you either.

You can rate [[ThomasSchwinge]] and donate money to the _[[FreeSoftwareFoundation]]'s Hurd fund_ [through Affero](http://rate.affero.net/tschwinge/Hurd/). (Where will the money end up? And what will it be used for? [[ThomasSchwinge]] is currently trying to find the answers to this question.)

For explicitely donating to [[ThomasSchwinge]] [go here](http://nic-nac-project.de/~schwinge/donate.html).
