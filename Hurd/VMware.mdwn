GNU won't work in VMware, it hangs when reaching the Hurd bootstrap.

Note that Vmware is not supported software to run the Hurd on it. Reasons include:

a) Vmware is not [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), which is against our philosophy.

b) Obtaining a licensed copy to debug it costs (at least) $300.

c) Vmware's sources and specification are not publicly available, which makes debugging tasks really painful.

d) GNU is not in [Vmware's official supported operating systems page](http://www.vmware.com/support/ws3/doc/ws31_guestosa2.html).

We recommend to use [free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) alternatives, like [Bochs](http://www.vmlinux.org/twiki/bin/view/Hurd/Bochs).
