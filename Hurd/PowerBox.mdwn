In [[CapabilityBasedMicroKernel]], an application might be used with the very minimal set of capabilities that is needed to execute it, that is read-only access to it's libraries and files, plus maybe access to a specific IP connection or configuration directory.

Thus when the user asks to open or save a file, the dialog used to choose the file could also serve the purpose of granting the appropriate capabilities to the application.

This dialog is named the powerbox.
