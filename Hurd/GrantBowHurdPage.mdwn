This is just a sample.

Problems I'm having right now include compiling OSKit (not OSKit-Mach but OSKit itself) so that it will not reboot so quickly. I don't know why it's not loading.

I am also unable to get my PCI NE-2000 clone network card working. The driver loads but no routes are possible and therefore no packets get to the network. This is actually a DE-220 NIC that I started to discuss on hurd-help. Here's the actual change I made to gnumach-20020421/linux/dev/drivers/net/Space.c

static struct device eth0\_dev = \{ "eth0", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x240, 10, 0, 0, 0, &amp;eth1\_dev, ethif\_probe \};

Now that I have a second machine for Hurd development I hope to get around these problems with alternate hardware.

If anyone knows more about these items, please add your comments below with your signature.

Cheers,
