Here are some notes on my current Hurd activity.

I am also unable to get my PCI NE-2000 clone network card working. The driver loads but no routes are possible and therefore no packets get to the network. This is actually a DE-220 NIC that I started to discuss on hurd-help. Here's the actual change I made to gnumach-20020421/linux/dev/drivers/net/Space.c

       static struct device eth0_dev = {
           "eth0", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x240, 10, 0, 0, 0, &eth1_dev, ethif_probe };

Cheers,

Booting OSKit-Mach mysteriously works now! Yeah! I didn't even change anything!

My problems now is how to get my second machine's (hd0,2) (/dev/hda3 for linux folks) partitionto bre recognized by Grub. When I try 'root (hd0,2)' grub spits back 'Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x83'. This is a standard ext2 /boot partition from my test Progeny install. I even removed the partition, added it back, fsck.ext2 and moved the files back. It still doesn't see the -filesystem-. Very strange. This prevents me from using my second machine right now.
