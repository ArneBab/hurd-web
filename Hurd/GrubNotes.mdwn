While [Neal's install guide](http://web.walfield.org/papers/hurd-installation-guide/english/hurd-install-guide.html) is very good it does not have complete information regarding the GRUB boot loader. The syntax is also different from Lilo's and so to scratch my own itch I'm creating this quick reference. The [Grub manual](http://www.gnu.org/manual/grub/html_mono/grub.html) is another good reference.

* update-grub is **Debian specific** and very nice. It will automatically create a /boot/grub/menu.lst file for the kernels in /boot/. It will also append a manually configured set for other partitions like the GNU/Hurd.

* essential Grub commands
  * root
  * kernel
