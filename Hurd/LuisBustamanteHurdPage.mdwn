Nothing much to see right now, I'll add some stuff I'm working in the near future! :)

After making some trivial/incorrect patches (thanks Neal :) for building um-pppd with gcc 3.0.4 in Debian (see [\#147085](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=147085&repeatmerged=yes)) this weekend I'll finally give it a try, I got an external modem... anyway serial drivers seem to be broken in GNUmach iirc, I won't get much more than 300b/s :).

Keep Hurding!
