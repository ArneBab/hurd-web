GNU pre0.3-J2 for Bochs mini-FAQ

----

- What do you mean "GNU", the GNU Hurd?

Yes and no. See <http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q1-2>

- Where are...?

Latest version of this FAQ: <http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Hurd/BochsFAQ>

Latest GNU image for Bochs: [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group\_id=12580](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12580)

- Disk line for .bochsrc?

for Bochs 2.0 or later:

ata0-master: type=disk, path="gnu.img", cylinders=1024, heads=16, spt=63

for older versions:

diskc: file="gnu.img", cyl=1024, heads=16, spt=63

- My PATH and prompt are weird, and X clients fail

the profile is not loaded properly, do it manualy with ". /etc/profile".

- How can i change terminals?

The Mach console doesn't have multi-terminal capability, and the usual solution is the "screen" program, but..

..the new console server is installed and configured with 6 terminals. beware it hasn't been properly tested. You can launch it with the ncursesw driver:

console -d ncursesw /dev/vcs

and then switching via C-w 1 (or 2, 3, ...). you can exit it with C-w x

see <http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2002/debian-hurd-200209/msg00054.html> for more details

IMPORTANT: note that X doesn't work well while running the console server.

- Does X work?

Somewhat:

- DRI and speedo modules won't load so they're deactivated. - The VESA driver also failed so VGA is being used. - more than 8 bpp won't work. - for some weird reason the mouse server in /dev/mouse doesn't respond, so the mouse is inoperative. - GNU is still an unstable OS which makes X crash often on it.

To reconfigure it:

dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

then apply a patch to fix the mouse section:

patch /etc/X11/XF86config-4 /root/XF86Config-4.diff

Installed clients are blackbox window manager and rxvt terminal emulator.

- Is network configured?

Yes, to change parameters use:

settrans -apfg /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet [options to pfinet]

(see /hurd/pfinet --help for details)

- How do i mount stuff?

settrans -afg  /hurd/

Where node is your mount point and translator is the filesystem server. Add -p to settrans if you want it to stay over reboots (fstab-like)

- Anything neat to try?

yes! instead of "su" use "sush", a more flexible version that manages multiple UIDs.

you can also play with userspace filesystems for NFS and FTP in /hurd/\{nfs,ftpfs\} that you can run as user, debug with GDB, etc.
