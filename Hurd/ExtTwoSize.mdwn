## <a name="Ext2_File_system_limitation"> Ext2 File system limitation </a>

This is a very common question. Many people have problems with the partition limit on Ext2 filesystems being very small by current standards. It feels smaller all the time as people have larger disks and often larger filesystems. It's worth mentioning that 64-bit machines (ia64, alpha) will not have this limitation.
