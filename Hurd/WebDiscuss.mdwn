I would like to redo the top introduction of [[WebHome]] a bit. Something more like this:

## <a name="The_Hurd"> The Hurd </a>

This part of the wiki is dedicated to the the Hurd servers, the most important components comprising the GNU operating system. Built on top of the Mach microkernel the servers are designed to replace the functionality provided by regular monolithic UNIX kernels.

If you cannot find what you look for the topic might have been moved to the new Distrib, Mach or GNU TWiki webs. This has been done to help clarify the different aspects of the GNU/Hurd efforts for new users.

For an introduction to this site, see <http://hurd.gnufans.org>.
