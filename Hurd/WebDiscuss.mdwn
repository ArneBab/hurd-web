Two things I've been thinking about are removing much of the bottom half of the [[WebHome]] page (TWiki stuff) and creating a template to make pages here look identical to the <http://hurd.gnu.org> pages.

Good idea!

Personally I'm still not happy with the way we administer the WebMenu. Currently there are X menus for X webs when we could have just one - the TWiki.WebMenu.

The menu is designed to, by default, only show items for the currently selected web. If it is OK with you I'll unify the menus and change the "Edit Menu" link to point to the TWiki.WebMenu

I noticed you've removed the DEFAULTITEMS completely. I think I know why - because the the names of the standard TWiki topics where too confus -- [[Main/JoachimNilsson]] - 22 Nov 2002

I created those menus because the default was not working correctly and I didn't know how else to fix it. Other than making it manual. Every menu was showing every item. I also wanted to set s specific order to the webs. If you can make it work exactly the way I've manually configured it, knock yourself out. It would be "better" to use some of the automated features, but I would rather that users get a consistent navigation than it not work correctly, you know?

My last round of edits to the [[WebMenus]] was to change [[MiG]] to Mig. The web names should be able to be used in a [[Mig/WebMenu]] fashion. Navigation must be consistent no matter how it's implemented.
