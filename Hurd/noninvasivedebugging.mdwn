Sometimes using gdb on a server can result in
deadlock.  You can still use gdb by using
the "set noninvasive" option.  This indicates
to gdb to not stop the program but allows you to
nevertheless examine its state.  Thus, you can get back traces
and value of variables (and watch them change underneath you).
