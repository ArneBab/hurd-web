If you've got more money on hand than hacking time, you might consider buying some [maintenance points](http://g10code.com/products.html) ($10 a point) to help the Hurd along. From the [g10 Code](http://g10code.com/main.html) site...

> Hurd Maintenance Points are special: Some of our employees are well known Hurd hackers in their spare time; collected points for this program will be given to them in form of paid time.

See also this related [mailings-list](http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-hurd/2003-04/msg00044.html) thread.

And of course you can also donate to the [Free Software Foundation](https://agia.fsf.org/mp/order.py?make-donation=1) (just specify you want to contribute to the Hurd project).
