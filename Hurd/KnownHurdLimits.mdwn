When comparing the Hurd (and its [[Mach/GnuMach]] microkernel) to alternatives please remember that the last released version number is 0.2. For example, Linux, the kernel, took awhile to mature. The Debian GNU/Hurd system is developing rapidly. Assistance with programming and support tasks is greatly appreciated. The general [Hardware Compatibility Guide](http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/thug/gnumach_hardware.html) is another good reference. Now for the list of known limitations of the Hurd.

* ~1.5+ GB ext2 partition size limit ([[ExtTwoSize]])

* missing hardware drivers. Current [[Mach/GnuMach]] drivers are from Linux 2.0. [[Mach/OskitMach]] will have Linux 2.2 drivers.

* swap is highly [recommended](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q2-7).

* minimum of 8 MB has been reported to work, but 32 MB is more realistic. Don't forget to use plenty of swap space.

* 768 megabytes RAM maximum [approximately](http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/thug/gnumach_hardware.html#Memory).

* /dev/random and /dev/urandom default solutions missing (in progress, see [[RandomDevice]])

* No dhcp client is present yet. (See [[DhcpClient]])

* [[HurdConsole]] server not in CDs or tarballs yet

* PthreadsLibrary not in CDs or tarballs yet

* sound support missing (in progress)

* um-pppd missing (see [[PppDaemon]])

* XFree86 is stabilizing

* fatfs translator is stabilizing but it does not have partition limits that get in the way. ([0\.4 released Oct 6, 2002](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-October/010576.html))

* USB support is missing

* [Ext3 implementation](http://debian.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/~ogi/hurd/ext3fs/) is not started yet

A few items here are not specific are dependent or closely related to Hurd servers. Some has to do with more "distribution" or porting of other software in addition to Hurd server hooks. I'll leave it here for now. Most of it does belong in this web.
