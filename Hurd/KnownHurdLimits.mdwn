When comparing the Hurd (including it's [[GnuMach]] microkernel) to alternatives please remember that the last released version number is 0.2. For example, the Linux Kernel took awhile to mature. The Debian GNU/Hurd system is developing rapidly. Assistance with programming and support tasks is greatly appreciated. The general [Hardware Compatibility Guide](http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/thug/gnumach_hardware.html) is another good reference. Now for the list of known Gnu/Hurd limitations.

* 1GB hard disk [partition limit](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q2-6) ([Nov 2001](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/hurd-devel/2001q4/000135.html) and [March 2002](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/hurd-devel/2002q1/000221.html) status) It's worth mentioning that 64-bit machines will not have this limitation.

* missing hardware drivers. Current [[GnuMach]] drivers are from Linux Kernel version 2.0. [[OskitMach]] will have Linux Kernel version 2.2 drivers.

* USB support is missing

* swap is highly [recommended](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q2-7).

* 768 megabytes RAM [approximately](http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/thug/gnumach_hardware.html#Memory).

* /dev/random and /dev/urandom default solutions missing (in progress, see [[RandomDevice]]) [random.tar.gz](ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/hurd/contrib/marcus/random.tar.gz)

* console server not released for oskit-mach (in progress)

* sound support missing (in progress)

* um-pppd missing ([in progress](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no\&bug=147085))

* XFree86 is stabilizing

* fatfs translator is stabilizing
