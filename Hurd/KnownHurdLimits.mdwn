When comparing the Hurd (including it's [[GnuMach]] microkernel) to alternatives please remember that the last released version number is 0.2. For example, the Linux Kernel took awhile to mature. The Debian GNU/Hurd system is developing rapidly. Assistance with programming and support tasks is greatly appreciated. Now for the list of known Gnu/Hurd limitations.

* 1GB hard disk [partition limit](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q2-6)
* missing hardware drivers. Current [[GnuMach]] drivers are from Linux Kernel version 2.0. [[OskitMach]] will have Linux Kernel version 2.2 drivers.
* alot of swap is [recommended](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q2-7).
* lack of released console in oskit-mach (in progress)
* no sound support (in progress)
* XFree86 is stabilizing
* fatfs translator is stabilizing
