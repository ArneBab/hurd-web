## <a name="POSIX_Threads_for_the_Hurd"> </a> POSIX Threads for the Hurd

One of the features the Hurd has been lacking up til now is support for POSIX threads, pthreads. It has been the show stopper for porting many useful applications and has sometimes been pointed out as one of the bigger problems with the GNU operating system.

In 2002 however, all this came to an end when Neal Walfield implemented libpthreads for his work on L4 and decided to also make it work on GNUmach.

Information on the library can be found on Neals web site.

## <a name="Previous_Attempts"> Previous Attempts </a>

Plans to implement pthreads for the Hurd has existed since, at least, 1999. Mark Kettenis [1] began work that was supposed to be useful on Linux as well. His work was continued by Igor Khavikine [2], who implemented most of it. Igor could however not continue his work so it was picked up by Jeroen Dekkers [3] and Ryan Golbeck. Their work can be found on Savannah, <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/pthreads/>.
