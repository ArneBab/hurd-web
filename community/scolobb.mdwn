Project: Namespace-based translator selection

---

## Current Task

Write the filesystem proxy for namespace-based translator selection (*nsmux*).

The code is at <http://github.com/scolobb/nsmux/tree/master>.

---

###Current Status

####DONE:

* The skeleton which mirrors the filesystem.

* Provided the looking up of files with special suffixes like 'file,,x'

* Implemented the propagation of a translator on all files belonging
  to directory 'dir' in the case of the following query: 'dir,,x/'

* Any translator can access the untranslated version of the node it is
  to be set upon by specifying the corresponding flags to the
  *lib*_startup routine, where *lib* is the name of the library used
  to create the translator.

####TODO:

* Create special translators for the main proxy so that its functionality
  should be complete.

* Refine the skeleton in several places so that it should become faster
  and more reliable.

* Kill bugs.

###Progress

####6: Fri Jul 25, ~04:00 UTC - ?

> Implementing a skeleton of the translator that should filter the translator stack it is set upon.

####5: Thu Jul 24, ~17:00 UTC - Thu Jul 24, ~18:30 UTC:

> Created a *libnetfs*-based one-node translator, working exactly like the *libtrivfs*-based translator I had written before; the former, however, can be included in a translator stack.

####4: Tue Jul 22, ~15:00 UTC - Thu Jul 24, ~17:00 UTC:

> Attempted to make a *libtrivfs*-based translator to be able to be stacked upon itself (to be able to receive a translator on top of itself, more exactly); attempted to   borrow some code from *libnetfs* but this didn't bring any results.

####3: Sun Jul 20, ~15:00 UTC - Tue Jul 22, ~15:00 UTC:

> Implemented the possibility to propagate a translator on all files belonging to a directory 'dir' in the request of the type 'dir,,x/'.

####2: Thu Jul 17, ~13:00 UTC - Fri Jul 18, ~21:00 UTC:

> Extended the lookup code in *nsmux* to allow for looking up nodes like 'file,,x' and added the possibility to escape the double-comma in the following way: ',,,'.

####1: Mon Jul 12, ~13:00 UTC - Tue Jul 13, ~15:00 UTC:

> Implemented a simple *libtrivfs*-based translator to test the lookup code for *nsmux*.

####0: Sat Jul 12, ~09:00 UTC - Sat Jul 12, ~18:00 UTC:

> Made small changes to the code of *filterfs* to fit the needs of *nsmux*.

---

## Completed Tasks

####2: Sat May 3 - Fri Jul 17:

> Write a translator that should filter the contents of the directory it is set on according to some property. The property can be an arbitrary command.

> The code is at <http://github.com/scolobb/filterfs/tree/master>.

####1: Mon Apr 28 - Wed Apr 30:

> Wrote a Python extension module in C for retreiving the uptime. The module is based on the code of *w*.

####0: Sun Apr 27:

> Followed the code of *dmesgd* (<http://www.bddebian.com/junk/dmesgd/>) kindly offered by **bddebian** and rewritten it from scratch as a tutorial.
