Project: Namespace-based translator selection

---

## Current Task
Write a translator that should filter the contents of the directory it is set on according to some condition. The condition can be an arbitrary command (might change).

> **Note**: The previous task about writing a tar translator was abandoned, because this new task better fits the goal of gathering information regarding namespace-based translator selection.

### Progress

####4: Sun May 11, ~19:00 UTC - ?:

> Preparing stubs for functions required by diskfs and pager.

####3: Tue May 6, ~17:30 UTC - Sat May 10, ~17:30 UTC:

> Looked through the code of *isofs* (starting here <http://www.htu.tugraz.at/~past/hurd/global/S/148.html#127>), and through **Hurd Reference Manual** (<http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/reference-manual/hurd.html#SEC106>).

####2: Mon May 5, ~18:00 UTC - ~20:00 UTC:

> Rewrote the *helloworld* translator from scratch.

> **Note**: The example *hello.c* does not compile on my debian-hurd because of differences in function prototypes (apparently, *hello.c* is a bit old :-) ).

####1: Sat May 3, ~8:00 UTC - ~21:00 UTC:

> Read **The Hurd Hacking Guide** (<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hacking-guide/hhg.html>).

####0: Sat May 3, ~16:00 UTC:

> Task suggested by **antrik**.

## Completed Tasks

####1: Mon Apr 28 - Wed Apr 30:

> Wrote a Python extension module in C for retreiving the uptime. The module is based on the code of *w*.

####0: Sun Apr 27:

> Followed the code of *dmesgd* (<http://www.bddebian.com/junk/dmesgd/>) kindly offered by **bddebian** and rewritten it from scratch as a tutorial.
