The GNU Hurd project has been accepeted as a mentoring organization for
the [Google Summer of Code
2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/hurd/about.html)!

If you are a student interested in participating (or just curious :-) ), see
our list of [[project_ideas]]. Suggestions for other interesting projects are
welcome too of course :-)

Student application period starts Monday, 2008-03-24. You might want to take a
look at the draft for the [[application_template|student_application_form]] to
see what is awaiting you.

Also, if none of the GNU Hurd project proposals is appealing to you, feel
invited to have a look at the [GNU-wide
list](http://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas.html).
