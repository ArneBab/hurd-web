The GNU Hurd project has been accepted as a mentoring organization for
the [Google Summer of Code
2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/hurd/about.html)!

Student selection is over, and we have four slots -- quite some more than the
one we had the previous years under the GNU umbrella... Let's hope for some
good results :-)

The selected projects are:

* Lisp binding for Hurd translator libraries
* Network virtualization for subhurds etc.
* Usable procfs implementation
* dtrace support

The community bonding period has begun now, and lasts till the summer session
starts by the end of May. Students are now preparing their projects, getting to
know the stuff they will work on, as well as... us, the Hurd community :-)

## History

2006 and 2007 we participated in GSoC under the umbrealla of the GNU project,
getting one slot each year.
