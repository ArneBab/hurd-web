# 2010

This year we are again participating in [Google Summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com)
under the [GNU umbrella](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject).
Take a look at our [[project_ideas]] list.
If you are a student and want to apply for one of these tasks,
please mind the distinct [[student_application_form]] for the Hurd.

Note that there are also two [Hurd-related ideas for X.Org](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Hurd_Porting),
for which students should apply to [X.Org](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home/google/gsoc2010/xorg) as a mentoring organization;
and the [[project_ideas/debian_installer]] task
most likely will be handled by the [Debian organisation](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home/google/gsoc2010/debian).

If you can't participate as a GSoC student,
working on one of these projects is still a good opportunity to get started with Hurd development.
Please read up about [[contributing]] in general;
and feel free to ask any questions you might have at one of our [[regular_IRC_meetings|IRC#regular_meetings]].
Generally it's a good idea to [[contact_us|communication]] when starting to work on some project.

# History

In 2006 and [[2007]], we participated in GSoC under the umbrella of the GNU
project,
getting one slot each year.

In the following year, we successfully participated on our own, not only as a
suborganization of the GNU
project.  Read about our five students' success on the [[2008]] page.

The next year, we participated under the GNU umbrella with one slot again.
Read about it on the [[2009]] page.
