# 2009

The Google Summer of Code is currently in the planning phase.


# History

2006 and 2007 we participated in GSoC under the umbrella of the GNU project,
getting one slot each year.

<!-- TODO.  Extend.  -->

In 2008 we successfully participated on our own, no longer within the GNU
project.  Read about our five students' success on the [[2008]] page.


# Joining in

If these successes got you interested in contributing some larger part yourself -
in your free time or maybe in next years Google Summer of Code - 
please have a look at our [[project_ideas]] and read up about [[contributing]].
