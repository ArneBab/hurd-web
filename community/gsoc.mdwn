The GNU Hurd project has been accepted as a mentoring organization for
the [Google Summer of Code
2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/hurd/about.html)!

If you are a student interested in participating (or just curious), see our
list of [[project_ideas]].  Suggestions for other interesting projects are
welcome too, of course, so don't hesitate to come up with your own proposals!
(You're, however, very much encouraged to [[discuss|communication]] them with
us prior to submitting.)

The student application period starts Monday, 2008-03-24 and lasts until
Monday, 2008-04-07 (has been
[extended](http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce/browse_thread/thread/9fa88f31aa401f70)).

You might want to take a
look at the draft for the [[application_template|student_application_form]] to
see what is awaiting you.  As well, you're encouraged to carefully read through
the [GNU guidelines for Summer of Code
projects](http://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/guidelines.html) before
writing and handing in your application.  (But keep in mind that these are for
a different mentoring organization, so not everything described there applies
to us...) And again: [[ask|communication]] if there are questions.

Also, if none of the GNU Hurd project proposals appeals to you, feel
invited to have a look at the [GNU-wide
list](http://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas.html).


## History

2006 and 2007 we participated in GSoC under the umbrealla of the GNU project,
getting one slot each year.
