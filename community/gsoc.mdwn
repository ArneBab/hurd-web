# 2010

We haven't been accepted as a mentoring organization on our own, but will
participate under the umbrella of the GNU project.

Students, have a look at our [[project_ideas]] list and the
[[student_application_form]].


# History

In 2006 and [[2007]], we participated in GSoC under the umbrella of the GNU
project,
getting one slot each year.

In the following year, we successfully participated on our own, not only as a
suborganization of the GNU
project.  Read about our five students' success on the [[2008]] page.

The next year, we participated under the GNU umbrella with one slot again.
Read about it on the [[2009]] page.


# Joining in

If these successes got you interested in contributing some larger part yourself -
in your free time or maybe in next years Google Summer of Code - 
please have a look at our [[project_ideas]] and read up about [[contributing]].

Also, feel free to ask your questions at one of our
[[regular_IRC_meetings|IRC#regular_meetings]].
