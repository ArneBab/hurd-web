# 2009

The GNU Hurd project this year unfortunately is not in the list of accepted
mentoring organizations.

However, don't despair!  This doesn't mean that you'd not be allowed to work on
your favorite GNU Hurd project.  For one, there's the possibility that a slot
for your project can be allocated under the [auspices of the GNU
project](http://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/).  Second, we're of course
always open to introducing newcomers to the world of the GNU Hurd outside of
any Google Summer of whatever project.  Just pick a task from the list pointed
to below on this page and get in touch with us!

<!-- The GSoC 2009 student application time has come to an end -- we
are now evaluating your applications. -->

The applications have been evaluated and the following student has
been accepted:

* [[Sergiu Ivanov (scolobb)]]

# History

2006 and 2007 we participated in GSoC under the umbrella of the GNU project,
getting one slot each year.

<!-- TODO.  Extend.  -->

In 2008 we successfully participated on our own, no longer within the GNU
project.  Read about our five students' success on the [[2008]] page.


# Joining in

If these successes got you interested in contributing some larger part yourself -
in your free time or maybe in next years Google Summer of Code - 
please have a look at our [[project_ideas]] and read up about [[contributing]].

Also, feel free to ask your questions at one of our
[[regular_IRC_meetings|IRC#regular_meetings]].
