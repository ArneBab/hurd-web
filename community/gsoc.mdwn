2006 and 2007 we participated in GSoC under the umbrealla of the GNU project,
getting one slot.

This year we will try to apply as an own organisation. Don't know whether we
have a chance of getting more than one slot that way; but regardless of that,
this should allow us to attract more potential students, and allow for a more
targetted selection process.

Please help improve and/or comment on the drafts for the
[[organization_application]] form, the [[project_ideas]] list, and the
[[student_application_form]].
