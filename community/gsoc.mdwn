# 2010

This year we are again participating in [Google Summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com)
under the [GNU umbrella](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject).

  * *[[Jeremie Koenig|jkoenig]]*, mentored by *[[Samuel
    Thibault|samuelthibault]]*, is working on adapting the Debian Installer to
    [produce working Debian GNU/Hurd installation
    images](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/debian/t127230758239)
    so we can easily offer up to date disc-sets.
    ([Details](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/HurdDebianInstaller/JeremieKoenig).)

  * *[[Emilio Pozuelo Monfort|pochu]]*, mentored by *Carl Fredrik Hammar* (who
    was a GSoC student in 2007), is working on a task that may be perceived as
    less exciting from the outside, but yet is extremely valuable: [fixing
    compatibility problems exposed by projects'
    testsuites](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759396).
    ([[Details|community/gsoc/project_ideas/testsuites]].)

  * *[[Karim Allah Ahmed|kam]]*, mentored by *Sergio López*, is working on
    [tuning the VM Subsystem in
    GNU/Hurd](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759587)
    to bring the virtual memory management in Hurd/Mach up to date.
    ([[Details|community/gsoc/project_ideas/vm_tuning]].)

We always ask students that want to apply for a task (in the course of the
Google Summer of Code) to mind our distinct [[student_application_form]].

Apart from our own [[project_ideas]], there are also two [Hurd-related ideas
for X.Org](http://wiki.x.org/wiki/Hurd_Porting).

As the Google Summer of Code 2010 has already started, you can no longer
participate as a GSoC student.  However,
working on one of these projects is still a good opportunity to get started with Hurd development.
Please read up about [[contributing]] in general;
and feel free to ask any questions you might have at one of our [[regular_IRC_meetings|IRC#regular_meetings]].
Generally it's a good idea to [[contact_us|communication]] when starting to work on some project.

# History

In 2006 and [[2007]], we participated in GSoC under the umbrella of the GNU
project,
getting one slot each year.

In the following year, we successfully participated on our own, not only as a
suborganization of the GNU
project.  Read about our five students' success on the [[2008]] page.

The next year, we participated under the GNU umbrella with one slot again.
Read about it on the [[2009]] page.
