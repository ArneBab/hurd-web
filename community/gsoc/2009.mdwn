The GNU Hurd project unfortunately was not in the list of accepted
mentoring organizations.

We did get one slot from the GNU project's.

The applications have been evaluated and the following student has
been accepted:

  * [[Sergiu Ivanov|scolobb]] -- working on a *[[VFS-style union
    mount|hurd/translator/unionmount]]* functionality; [Google's project
    page](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/karlberry/t124022551214).
