* What is your Organization's Name?

GNU Hurd

* What is your Organization's Homepage?

* Describe your organization.

The Hurd project is a loose community of people sharing a common interest in
developing the Hurd kernel, which is the official kernel of the [GNU operating
system](http://gnu.org).

When the Hurd was originally started in 1990, it was the last missing major
component for a complete GNU system. Today Linux and other free kernels are
available to fill this gap, and the combination of GNU and Linux (often
incorrectly called just "Linux") is in wide use. However, the Hurd is still
interesting due to its unique design, better fitting the GNU philosophy than
traditional monolithic kernels like Linux.

The GNU GPL guarantees that all users of software published under this license
get the legal permission to adapt the software they are using according to
their wishes, as well as the source code and other tools necessary to put this
permission to use. However, in traditional operating systems, the kernel and
related low-level system software are protected from normal users, and cannot
be easily modified; only the system administrator has power over these.

The Hurd offers special mechanisms that allow any user to change almost all of
the system functionality he uses, without affecting the rest of the system, and
thus easily (at runtime) and without any special permissions.

This ability to run subenvironments more or less independant from the rest of
the system, can be classified as a very sophisticated [lightweight
virtualization](http://tri-ceps.blogspot.com/2007/10/advanced-lightweight-virtualization.html)
approach.

To offer these possibilities, the Hurd uses a true multiserver microkernel
architecture. That makes it quite unique: The Hurd is the only general-purpose
multiserver microkernel system in development today being nearly ready for
everyday use, and offering almost perfect UNIX compatibility. (More than half
of the packages in the Debian repository are available for the Hurd.) All other
existing true microkernel systems are either research projects not nearly
complete enough for actual use, or limited to embedded systems and other
special purposes, or both.

Marcus Brinkmann and Neal Walfield from the Hurd project are working at the
bleeding edge of microkernel operating system research. They have been in
contact with the most distinguished researchers from the L4 and EROS/Coyotos
microkernel operating system groups, and have published a research paper.

* Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2008? What do you
hope to gain by participating?

For one, it is a way to make progress with tasks that require an amount of
focused work that is hard to do for volunteers usually working in their spare
time only. Also it is a good possibility to get valuable input from new people,
as well as spreading technical and other knowledge about the Hurd among actual
and potential contributors. More generally, participation should help raising
awareness among people who might know about the existence of the Hurd, but
otherwise having very little idea what the project is all about, and how its
progress is.

* Did your organization participate in previous GSoC years? If so, please
summarize your involvement and the successes and failures of your student
projects.

We did not participate as an organisation so far. In 2006 and 2007, we
participated under the umbrella of the GNU project, getting one slot each year.

The 2006 participation was mostly a failure. After some intitial work
(available in CVS), the student disappeared -- moving to another country and
other personal issues from what we heard.

The 2007 participation was a considerable success. The student was very bright
and dedicated. We got some code and a lot of ideas, which we continued
discussing after the end of GSoC. It might result in a followup project this
year.

We decided to participate as an own organisation this year, as we believe that
will give us much better possibilities to find and select good students.

* If your organization has not previously participated in GSoC, have you
applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?

We didn't apply as as organisation so far.

* What license does your project use?

Most of the code in the Hurd servers and the Hurd-specific glibc parts is
licensed GPLv2 or later; it might move to GPLv3 soon. Some components (mostly
the TCP/IP stack and parts of the ext2fs driver) are based on Linux code and
thus GPLv2 only.

The microkernel (gnumach) is covered by the BSD license. (And some minor
variations...)

* What is the main development mailing list for your organization?

bug-hurd@gnu.org, see http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-hurd

* Where is the main IRC channel for your organization?

\#hurd on freenode.net

* Does your organization have an application template you would like to see
students use? If so, please provide it now.

(coming soon...)

* Who will be your backup organization administrator? Please enter their Google
Account address. We will email them to confirm, your organization will not
become active until they respond.

...

* What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors? Please be
as specific as possible.

The most important criterium is that the person is involved in the project for
some time, knowing the ways; so he can actually instruct the student; and if
there are tough technical questions he can't answer himself, he knows whom to
ask.

It's also important that the mentors are reliable and helpful, so the students
won't be left on their own with any problems they face.

* Who will your mentors be? Please enter their Google Account address separated
by commas. If your organization is accepted we will email each mentor to invite
them to take part.

* What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?

The plan is mostly to avoid that happening in the first place. For that, we
will be particularily careful with the selection of the students: Making sure
that they have no other obligations during that time; that they are motivated
enough; that they actually have the necessary skills to complete the task; that
they fit in our community.

Also, we will make sure that we are constantly in contact with the students --
asking about progress, discussing technical issues, etc. -- so we can act in
time if things go wrong.

If a student disappears in spite of that, there is little we can do. Of course
we will try to contact him and find out what the problem is; whether the
project can perhaps be scaled down, or at least wrapped up to bring it in a
state where it is useful even if not finished.

We will also try to limit damage by insisting that students regularily check in
their work, so that we get partial results at least if someone disappears.

* What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?

As our mentors all have been with the project for some time, the risk of them
disappearing is not too big. If one of them disappears nevertheless, it's not a
problem for us: We have enough mentors, and someone else will take over.

We will encourage the students to keep discussions public as much as possible,
keeping private conversations with the mentors to a minimum, so the transition
should go smoothly.

* What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your
project's community before, during and after the program?

As part of the application process, we will ask students to answer very
specific questions about our organisation and their project, which they won't
be able to do without contacting us and discussing details already during the
application phase. This way we make sure we only get studends able and willing
to communicate with us.

During the program, we will actively be asking the students about the work they
do, problems they face, decisions they take etc.

After the program we will continue discussing the projects, and ask the
students to take part in these discussions.

* What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project
after GSoC concludes?

We will try to invite all participating students to a conference afterwards,
where we will discuss the projects, as well as other Hurd-related topics. We
hope this will motivate them to follow up on the work they have done during the
program, and generally help keeping them involved.
