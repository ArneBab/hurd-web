This list offers a wide range of tasks: From rather straightforward to pretty
involved ones; from low-level kernel hacking (drivers, VM) to high-level
translators; from fixing bugs, implementing new functionality based on existing
interfaces, to creating totally new mechanisms.

If you have questions regarding the projects, or if there is more than one that
you are interested in and you are unsure which to choose, don't hesitate to
[[contact_us|communication]].

Most project descriptions mention a possible exercise related to the respective
task. Doing this exercise is part of the application process -- the purpose is
to get more familiar with the stuff you will need to complete the project and
with the Hurd community. Contact us if you encounter any difficulties -- we
will assist you with as well as we can :-)

Please report on the progress you make with the exercise. This allows us to get
a better picture of how well you can cope with the task; as well as how well
you manage the necessary communication with us :-)

The exercise is part of the application process, but it's perfectly OK if you
do it only after handing in the first version of your application. (The
experience you get with the exercise should help you to further improve your
application afterwards...) In general, don't hesitate too long -- the sooner
you submit your first proposal, the sooner we can give feedback!

Take a look at our [[application_template|student_application_form]] to get an
idea what your application should contain.
