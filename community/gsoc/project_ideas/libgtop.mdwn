[[!meta title="Porting libgtop"]]

/!\ On 2012-05-05 Andjos reported (commit
web.git:8061106f2d1f15fa9a54947bc45d4cba68d89bba) that this task has already
been completed.

libgtop is a library used by many applications (especially GNOME applications)
to abstract the system-specific methods for obtaining information about the
current state of the system -- processes running, system load etc.

A Linux-compatible [[hurd/translator/procfs]] is available
and should cover a large part of the functionality of
libgtop. However, not all necessary information is exported via /proc (even on
Linux); there are some bits still missing in the Hurd procfs implementation;
and there are a couple of bugs that need to be fixed to make it fully usable.

The goal of this project is a fully functional libgtop in Debian GNU/Hurd. Some
application(s) using it also need to be ported, e.g. gnome-system-monitor.

Some bits of this work are easy, others need some digging into Hurd internals.
This task doesn't require any specific previous knowledge (besides of general
C/UNIX programming skills of course); but during the course of the project,
some knowledge about Hurd internals will have to be obtained, along with a bit
of Debian stuff.

Possible mentors: Samuel Thibault (youpi)

Exercise: Fix one of the shortcomings in the existing procfs implementation.
