[[!meta title="Porting valgrind to the Hurd"]]

Valgrind is a very powerful tool to debunk bugs. However, in order to do so, it needs deep knowledge of the behavior of kernel traps. In the case of GNU/Hurd, there is a bunch of system calls that GNU Mach handles directly, but also all the MIG RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) which return their result either inline or through memory allocated by the kernel.

The goal is thus to teach valgrind the exact semantics of all MIG RPCs, most probably in an automatic way from the .defs files.

As a starter, students can try to teach valgrind a couple of Linux ioctls, as this will make them learn how to use the read/write primitives of valgrind.
