[[!meta title="Improving Perl or Python Support"]]

Perl and Python are available on the Hurd, but there are quite a lot of test suite
failures. These could be caused by problems in the system-specific
implementation bits of Perl/Python, and/or shortcomings in the actual system
functionality which Perl/Python depends on.

The student applying for this project can pick either Perl or Python,
whichever he is more comfortable with.
(Perl is higher priority though; and there are more failures too.)

The goal then is to fix all of the problems with the chosen language if possible, or at
least some of them. Some issues might require digging quite deep into Hurd
internals, while others are probably easy to fix.

Note that while some Perl/Python knowledge is probably necessary to understand what
the test suite failures are about, the actual work necessary to fix these
issues is mostly C programming -- in the implementation of Perl/Python and/or the
Hurd.

Possible mentors: Samuel Thibault (youpi)

Exercise: Make some improvement to Perl/Python support on the Hurd, e.g. fixing one of
the known test suite failures.
