[[meta title="Fix File Locking"]]

Over the years, [[UNIX]] has aquired a host of different file locking mechanisms.
Some of them work on the Hurd, while others are buggy or only partially
implemented. This breaks many applications.

The goal is to make all file locking mechanisms work properly. This requires
finding all existing shortcomings (through systematic testing and/or checking
for known issues in the bug tracker and mailing list archives), and fixing
them.

This task will require digging into parts of the code to understand how file
locking works on the Hurd. Only general programming skills are required.

Possible mentors: Samuel Thibault (youpi)

Exercise: Find one of the existing issues, either by looking at the task/bug
trackers on savannah, or by trying things out yourself; and take a go at it.
Probably you wont' be able to fix the problem in a limited amount of time, but
you should be able to do a detailed analysis of the issue at least.
