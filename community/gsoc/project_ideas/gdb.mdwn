[[/GDB]] is available and working on GNU Hurd.  However, there are some bugs
and there is missing functionality compared to a port targeting the Linux
kernel ([[tag/Open_Issue_GDB]], [diff of
testresults](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/web.git/tree/gdb/test.diff?h=toolchain/logs/master)).
For example, there is no port of [[open_issues/gdb/gdbserver]] available yet.
Identifying (together with the mentors), and then addressing one or a few of
these items is the goal of this project.

Required knowledge: Have an understanding about how GDB works generally, how it
interacts with an operating system.  Some GNU Mach and Hurd knowledge will have
to be acquired while working on the project.

Possible mentors: [[Thomas Schwinge (tschwinge)|tschwinge]].

Exercise: Begin writing a document to describe how the GNU Hurd port of GDB
works internally, how it interacts with the Hurd system, and compare it to a
port targeting the Linux kernel.  Fix one of the Open Issues or testsuite
failures.
