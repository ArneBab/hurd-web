[[!meta title="Porting Google Go (GCC: gccgo)"]]

The goal of this project is to make the [Google Go programming
language](http://golang.org/) available on GNU/Hurd in its [[GCC]] *gccgo*
implementation.

Presumably less work will be needed on the language's frontend itself, but
rather on the supporting libraries.

Apart from a solid knowledge of the [[POSIX]] API, working knowledge of the
Google Go programming language is a must.  Some Hurd knowledge will have to be
acquired while working on the project.

Designing and implementing [[language_bindings]] is a follow-up project.

Possible mentors: Ian Lance Taylor: gccgo bits, [[Thomas Schwinge
(tschwinge)|tschwinge]]: Hurd bits.

Exercise: Fix one of the problems preventing *gccgo* from working on the Hurd.
