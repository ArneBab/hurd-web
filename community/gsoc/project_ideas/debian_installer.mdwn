[[meta title="Port the Debian Installer to the Hurd"]]

The primary means of distributing the Hurd is through Debian GNU/Hurd.
However, the installation CDs presently use an ancient, non-native installer.
The situation could be much improved by making sure that the newer *Debian
Installer* works on the Hurd.

Some preliminary work has been done, see
<http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Hurd>.

The goal is to have the Debian Installer fully working on the Hurd.  It
requires relatively little Hurd-specific knowledge.

Possible mentors: Samuel Thibault (youpi)

Exercise: Try to get one piece of the installer running on Hurd.
