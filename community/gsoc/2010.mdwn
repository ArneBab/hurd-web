[[!meta title="Google Summer of Code 2010"]]

In 2010 we have again been participating in the Google Summer of Code
under the GNU umbrella, with three slots:

  * *[[Jeremie Koenig|jkoenig]]*, mentored by *[[Samuel
    Thibault|samuelthibault]]*, has been working on adapting the Debian Installer to
    [produce working Debian GNU/Hurd installation
    images](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/debian/t127230758239)
    so we can easily offer up to date disc-sets.
    ([Details](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/HurdDebianInstaller/JeremieKoenig).)

  * *[[Emilio Pozuelo Monfort|pochu]]*, mentored by *Carl Fredrik Hammar* (who
    was a GSoC student in [[2007]]), has been working on a task that may be perceived as
    less exciting from the outside, but yet is extremely valuable: [fixing
    compatibility problems exposed by projects'
    testsuites](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759396).
    ([[Details|community/gsoc/project_ideas/testsuites]].)

  * *[[Karim Allah Ahmed|kam]]*, mentored by *Sergio López*, has been working on
    [tuning the VM Subsystem in
    GNU/Hurd](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759587)
    to bring the virtual memory management in Hurd/Mach up to date.
