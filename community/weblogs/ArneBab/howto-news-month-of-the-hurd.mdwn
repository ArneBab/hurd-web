[[!meta title="HowTo prepare and publish 'a month of the Hurd' for the next month"]]

We prepare the month of the Hurd in a public git branch (master-news_next) and merge it once we want to publish the news. 

For practical work that means, we use the following commands: 

* create a local branch for news_next

        git fetch && git checkout -b master-news_next origin/master-news_next

* get the latest version of news_next when you already created a local version of the branch

        git fetch && git checkout master-news_next 

Always do check which branch you're on (asterisk in the first column of
``git branch'''s output), and only then begin to do your changes and
commit them.

* create a new news entry

        cp news/yyyy-mm-dd.mdwn news/YYYY-MM-DD.mdwn
        (edit the new file)
        git add news/YYYY-MM-DD.mdwn
        git commit -m "Begun the news entry for YYYY-MM-DD."

(just copy the most recent news file)

* check the outgoing changes

        git log --reverse -p -C origin/master-news_next..master-news_next

* push the changes

        git push master-news_next

* if push fails, pull and rebase

        git pull --rebase

* publish the news

        git checkout master && git merge master-news_next

That means, for publishing we merge master-news_next into master.
