In the past few months the Hurd got quite many commits. 

I want to write a bit about the changes they brought, and what they mean to the Hurd. 

If some of my comments seem too 'simple' to you, just ignore them :) 

First we got many Bug fixes from Samuel Thibault, mainly in libpthread (multithreading), ext2fs and libdiskfs (both filesystem interaction). 

Then hurd-l4 (the port of the Hurd on the L4 kernel) seems to get quite much love by Neal H. Walfield (neal) at the moment. 
Quite much is saying a bit to little: hurd-l4 looks steamingly active in the commits :) 

And there is the [PyHurd](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyHurd) project. It attempts to create a full binding to the GNU/Hurd API, so people should someday be able to, for example, create translators in Python. 

There's been more - a lot more in fact, but much of it is above my coding horizon, and this entry shall end someplace (it's late - too late :) ). 

Best wishes, 
Arne
