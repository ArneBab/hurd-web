Today (OK, this night) I created some codeswarm movies to visualize the code history of the Hurd. 

What's particularly interesting to me in gnumach is the tschwinge - sthibaul effect in march 2008, where development suddenly seems to speed up enormeously. 

It clearly shows how much impact just two developers can have - you can have that kind of an impact, too! 

The code movies are created from the history of the cvs branches gnumach, hurd-l4 and 
hurd. 

The movies: 

 - [Gnumach](http://draketo.de/filme/codeswarm/gnumach_code_evolution.avi)

 - [Hurd](http://draketo.de/filme/codeswarm/gnu_hurd_code_evolution_1_min.avi)

 - [Hurd L4](http://draketo.de/filme/codeswarm/hurd-l4.avi)

 - [Hurd wiki](http://draketo.de/filme/codeswarm/hurd_wiki.avi)

in gnumach, red is the "kern", while in "hurd" red is stuff in "release". 

.*doc.* is dark blue and any stuff named .*linux.* is shown in a blue-green in 
both. In Hurd-L4 is annotated: It shows libc, gcc, Hurd and L4 kernel commits in 
different colors. 

The hurd wiki movie shows all web commits as "web-hurd@gnu.org", and you can clearly see that most changes are being done via the version control system. There's a way to split the web-commits, but since there aren't many, I leave that for another day :) - [article on the ikiwiki page](http://ikiwiki.info/news/code_swarm/).

Best wishes,
