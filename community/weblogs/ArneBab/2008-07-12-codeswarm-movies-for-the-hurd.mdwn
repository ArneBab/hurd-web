Today (OK, this night) I created some codeswarm movies to visualize the code history of the Hurd. 

What's particularly interesting to me in gnumach is the tschwinge - sthibaul effect in march 2008, where development suddenly seems to speed up enormeously. 

The code movies are created from the history of the cvs branches gnumach and hurd. 

The movies: 
- [gnumach](http://draketo.de/filme/cc-nc-sa/gnumach_code_evolution.avi)
- [hurd](http://draketo.de/filme/cc-nc-sa/gnu_hurd_code_evolution_1_min.avi)

in gnumach, red is the "kern", while in "hurd" red is stuff in "release". 

.*doc.* is dark blue and any stuff named .*linux.* is shown in a blue-green in 
both.

Also the hurd_wiki movie should be ready, soon :) 

Best wishes, 
Arne
