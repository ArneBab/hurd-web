Getting X to work on the GNU/Hurd
=================================

This is a try to get X to work in my qemu GNU/Hurd. 

Firstoff: I used the following guides: 

* [X Under the Hurd from debian-hurd](http://www.kerneltraffic.org/debian-hurd/dh20000112_31.html#3)
* [GNU/Hurd FAQ](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q4-7)


What I did
----------

I worked as root. 

First I installed xorg, x-window-system-code, rxvt and twm: 

    apt-get install xserver-xorg x-window-system-core rxvt twm

Then I set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DISPLAY

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib
    export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0

After that I set the mouse and keyboard translator. 

    settrans /dev/kbd /hurd/kbd /dev/kbd
    settrans -c /dev/mouse /hurd/mouse --protocol=ps/2

Then I started x

    startx

It didn't work yet - but watch the blog for updates - I'll post once I get it 
working.
