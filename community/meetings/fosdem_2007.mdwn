i.e including sdschulze, who hereby confirms

We need someone (not me, since I'm arriving on Saturday) to get the keys before
20:00. Reservations last until 16:00, so either he gets the keys before 16:00,
or I'll just need to call for confirming the reservation

## Youth Hostel Can Gogh

<http://chab.be/>

No under 18-ers and over 35-ers allowed.
