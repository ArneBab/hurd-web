i.e including sdschulze, who hereby confirms
-->

We need someone to get the keys before
20:00. Reservations last until 16:00, so either he gets the keys before 16:00,
or we just need to call for confirming the reservation

[[I|tschwinge]] seem to remember something that in 2007 the Madame at the
reception wasn't really happy with us arriving later than 16:00 even with
having had confirmed that via a phone call.
