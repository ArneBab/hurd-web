# What

On Sunday, there will be a [Alt-OS
devroom](http://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/FOSDEM2010AltOSDevroomSchedule) where at
least some of us will [spend their
time](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2009-12/msg00080.html).  Olaf
will be giving two presentations: *Why is Anyone Still Working on the GNU
Hurd?*, and *Porting KGI graphics drivers from Linux to GNU Hurd*.

There'll be further GNU folks around; [Mini GNU Hackers Meeting at FOSDEM
Brussels 2010](http://www.gnu.org/ghm/2010/fosdem/).
