## Summer session

Creating an extensible translator library in lisp using the mig generated stubs.

### What's done

- The library for writing translators is mostly written.
- This library is intended to implement virtual filesystems. Examples are: translators were data is located in a local file (like zipfs, tarfs, rarfs, ...), single file translators (that do content filtering, output of a command, etc), network based filesystems (ftpfs, httpfs, ...), proxy filesystems (like hostmux, usermux, etc..)
- It's possible to specialize the basic translator library and implement new translator classes. This is done using CLOS.
- There is a tree-translator class that makes the managing of a node tree very easy, doing all the work for us, through a simple directory API and implementing the directory callbacks for us.
- There is a simple example (something like zipfs) translator that can expose the directories and file contents of a ZIP file.
- More translator examples include:
  - /dev/null translator.
  - /dev/zero translator.
  - translator that creates a symlink node.
  - tmpfs like translator.
  - a translator that does proxying between clients and the underlying translator returning all data in upper-case.
  - a translator that watches for changes in a file describing the file system structure.
  - an IRC translator.
- Translator options (manipulated through fsysopts) have a simple and easy to use API.
- All the Mach port manipulation API is available.
- It's possible to send and receive messages. Simple example:
<pre>
  (let* ((spec-mixed (make-message-spec :fields '(:string :integer :char :string :integer :real)))
         (msg-mixed (make-message :spec spec-mixed))
         (port (port-allocate :right-receive)))
    (send-message msg-mixed :remote port :data (list "abc" 42 #\b "cba" 314 3.14))
    (receive-message msg-mixed :source port) ; This returns T on success.
    (get-message msg-mixed))) ; Returns '("abc" 42 #\b "cba" 314 3.14)
</pre>
- New message types (like :string, :integer) can be implemented, providing a powerful extension mechanism.
- Creation of symlinks and symlink path resolution.
- Creation of character/block devices, fifos and sockets.
- Patch that opens stdin + stdout to /dev/null.
- Project has been separated into 5 ASDF installable systems:
  - hurd-common
  - mach
  - hurd
  - hurd-translator
  - tree-translator
- Test cases are now written.


### What needs to be done

- Fix fsys-getroot (block happens in trivfs based translators, when they do RPC's to me when I call fsys_getroot to them) and fetch-root (for passive translators).
- Use the socket stubs?
- Documentation
- Integrate upstream:
  - Done, but still not commited.


### Project dependencies

- CLISP
- [CFFI](http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/) (apt-get installable)
- [Flexi streams](http://www.weitz.de/flexi-streams/) (apt-get installable)
- [Trivial garbage](http://www.cliki.net/trivial-garbage) (not in debian repositories)
- [cl-zip](http://common-lisp.net/project/zip/) (only needed for the example translator)
