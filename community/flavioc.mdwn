## Summer session

### kernel-agnostic DEFRPC macro

Will involve the creation of an API that can generate new RPC calls as [MIG](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mig.html) does but using Lisp macros.
This interface should be micro-kernel agnostic (see for instance [this](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/ng/)).
Of course the inner layer will be for GNU Mach, but it should be easy to port it to future kernels.

### Libraries to bind

- some mach types and functions
- libports
- [specific hurd api in glibc](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/glibc/hurd-specific_api/)
- fshelp
- iohelp

### RPC calls to bind

- io.defs
- fs.defs
- fsys.defs

### Pure lisp translator library

Once the bindings are working correctly, a libtrivfs translator like library should be written on top of that.
