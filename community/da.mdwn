Project: Network virtualization for subhurds etc.

The [code](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/VNetHurd/trac_subversion_tool).
The design and implementation of [hypervisor](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/VNetHurd/The_design_of_hypervisor).
The [schedule](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/b0f44qnbmr3AN4ab7jnrAJ/The_schedule_for_hypervisor).

## TODO
### Coding
Start to write the hypervisor:
-To create a virtual network interface.
-To publish the port created by the hypervisor. Two possible ways, I think:
-- call hurd_file_name_lookup() in the file system.
-- get it from the proc server.
-Trying both and see which can work.
