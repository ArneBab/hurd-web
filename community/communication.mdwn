The GNU Hurd community comprises of a crowd of people living in different areas
of the whole world.  For that, having regular working-[[meetings]] -- usually
one of the more productive ways of coordination works -- is not easily
possible.

The two key resources most often used for communication are the Debian and GNU
[[mailing_lists]], as well as [[IRC]].

If you're interested in keeping up with current events and taking part in
discussions, you'll want to join the [[mailing_lists/bug-hurd]] mailing list or
have a look at its [archives](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/).
