# <a name="Toronto_GNU_Hurd_User_Group"> </a> Toronto (GNU/)Hurd User Group

We are the first of the [[WebHome]] [[UserGroups]], and consequently the biggest! Our name is a slight misnomer, since we have plenty of members who live outside of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We have a members in the Kitchener/Waterloo area who are about two hours from Toronto (by automobile,) and a member in Oakland, California, USA who is about two hours from Toronto (by aeroplane.)

We are also expanding our reach. Currently our core members range in location from Montreal, PQ. to Waterloo, On.
