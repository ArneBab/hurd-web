A *UNIX process* is TODO.

Generally, especially in [[microkernel]]-based systems, the [[kernel]]'s idea
of a task is not as encompassing as a UNIX process, and will use additional
effort to enhance the kernel's primitive to a full-fledged UNIX model.

A [[Mach task|microkernel/mach/task]] implements a part of a UNIX process.

In the GNU/Hurd, processes are based on [[Mach task|microkernel/mach/task]]s,
but are [[enhanced by the glibc|glibc/process]].
