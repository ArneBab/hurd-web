> This month Samuel Thibault got the necessary Xen patches committed 
> into the unstable tree of Xen for the 4.0 release, 
> so GNU Mach now officially [has Xen domU support](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2009-12/msg00058.html)
> (GNU Mach instead of GNU Hurd, because 
> no changes were needed in the Hurd part). So from Xen 4.0 on you'll be able 
> to run the GNU Hurd directly using pv-grub - without the need to
> [prepare a multiboot package](http://youpibouh.thefreecat.org/hurd-xen/build_hurd-modules). 
> 
> Also the ddekit port of Zheng Da now 
> [passes the first tests](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2009-12/msg00060.html), 
> bringing us the first steps towards updated drivers. 
> 
> Additionally Thomas Schwinge started the planning for 
> [a GNU Hurd meeting at FOSDEM](http://www.thomas.schwinge.homeip.net/hurd-web/community/meetings/fosdem_2010.html]
> on February 6th/7th 2010 at the Université Libre de Bruxelles.
> 
> And some questions from Tim Kack from the view of a GNUstep developer 
> spawned an extensive discussion about 
> [SMP on the Hurd](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2009-12/msg00089.html).
