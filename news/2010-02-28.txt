> This month saw the first running and testable 
> [DDE driver by Zheng Da](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/user/zhengda/), 
> with which he begins to reap the benefits of porting DDE to Hurd, 
> because it allows developing drivers for GNU Hurd, *BSD und GNU/Linux 
> together. 
> 
> Also Samuel Thibault 
> [pushed libpciaccess to Xorg](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2010-January/048801.html), 
> which adds support in the Xserver (x86) “for OSes that do not have a PCI interface, tinkering with I/O ports, and makes use of it on GNU/Hurd.”
> 
> Additionally we saw the talks on the Hurd in the dev-alt room at [Fosdem](). in …s words: “… … …”.  
> Sadly we couldn't yet upload notes from the talks - as soon as these are availble, you'll get notice here. 
> 
> And it is time for the [[community/gsoc|Google_Summer_of_code]] again, so 
> [we started our weekly GSoC IRC meetings](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-02/msg00040.html http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/community/gsoc.html). 
> In these we coordinate the GSoC projects. 
> [[community/gsoc/2008|2008]] the GNU Hurd had 5 successful projects, 2009 saw [[user/scolobb|another_one]], and we hope to make it 5 projects again this year. 
> If you're interested in developing for the GNU Hurd in this years GSoC, or want to help with coordinatung, or simply want to be up to date, please come and join in.
