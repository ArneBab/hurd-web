> A bunch of patches have hit the mailing lists and source code repositories:

> Jérémie Koenig posted a [preliminary
> patch](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-06/msg00047.html) to
> add initrd (initial ramdisk) support in GNU Mach for his [[Google Summer of
> Code|community/gsoc]] 2010 project: [[Debian Installer|jkoenig]].  With this
> patch, and some other patches that are still in flux, he ended up being able
> to install a [[Debian GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] system using the Debian
> Installer -- which is the goal of his project.  Patches being *in flux* means
> that there's still work left to be done to properly solve some issues, so
> there's no need to worry that Jérémie wouldn't have any work left until the
> GSoC ends.

> Karim Allah Amed came up with the [first
> patch](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-06/msg00023.html) for
> porting the clustered paging-in code from OSF Mach to GNU Mach, which should
> improve the virtual memory performance of the Hurd.

> Emilio Pozuelo Monfort got a bug in [glibc
> fixed](http://sources.redhat.com/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=2a50c07836d2750baf70442f8f760bf6cd43b3af),
> which unblocks a problem we've seen in [coreutils'
> `ln`](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29655), and also continued to make
> progress on other grounds.

> [commit](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/commit-hurd/2010-06/msg00014.html)
> patches to make his [[DDE project|zhengda]] support block device drivers,
> apart from fixing some other issues, too.

> Samuel Thibault [fixed memory
> leaks](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/commit-hurd/2010-06/msg00018.html)
> in [[`pfinet`|hurd/translator/pfinet]], which is the Hurd's TCP/IP networking
> unit.  Even though that a crashed `pfinet` [[server|hurd/translator]] will be
> restarted upon its next use, having it eat up all system memory is to be
> avoided, of course -- and is corrected with these patches.

> Carl Fredrik Hammar submitted patches to improve the stability of the auth
> server ([rendezvous port
> death](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-06/msg00003.html) /
> [invalid rendezvous
> ports](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-06/msg00019.html)).

> Lastly, if you haven't seen it already: Richard Hillesley has posted an
> article [*GNU HURD: Altered visions and lost
> promise*](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/GNU-HURD-Altered-visions-and-lost-promise-1030942.html)
