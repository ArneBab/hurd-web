<!--basic structure of a MotH entry. Adapt, reduce and add points as needed. At the end, try to make the text flow as a unified whole.-->

The last two months Samuel Thibault [created](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-05/msg00189.html) the first Debian GNU/Hurd CD set with a graphical installer. You can dowload it at [the usual place for debian cdimages](http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-i386/installer/cdimage/).

Also Jeremie Koenig started working on his [[Google_Summer_of_Code_project|user/jkoenig/java]]: bringing not only Java to the Hurd but also adding missing parts in Hurd pthreads. As first treat he [added signal improvements](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-05/msg00182.html).
Meanwhile Tanguy le Carrour offered to sponsor some Hurd work, and followed up on his offer by adding Hurd bounties on FOSS factory - [[claim_them_if_you_can|news/2011-05-02-foss_factory]]! It’s no full additional GSoC, but a step in the right direction. So, if you have more money than time and want the Hurd to succeed, why don’t you join Tanguy?

On the technical side, Samuel Thibault [fixed a port-leak](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-05/msg00025.html) in file_reparent which got visible in the debian builder.

And on the organizational side, the Hurd now has a clear path to full inclusion in Debian: Since we now have a graphical installer, the next goal is to get as many packages ported as freekbsd (85%) for Wheezy, sometime between mid 2012 and beginning of 2013. We currently are at about 65%, so, if you always wanted to contribute to the Hurd and did not know how to help most effectively: [[Porting|contributing#porting]] is a great way to help improving the Hurd, especially now!

Finally, if you think that the MotH needs some spice up or misses crucial information, it is now much easier to contribute to it, because from this version onward, it is prepared [[publicly_in_the_wiki|contributing/web_pages/news/moth_next]], lowering the barrier of entry for news-writing. Feel free to [[contribute|contributing/web_pages/news]]!
