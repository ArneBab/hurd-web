We're pleased to announce new releases!

  * **GNU Hurd 0.8**,
    [NEWS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/hurd.git/tree/NEWS?id=v0.8):

        Version 0.8 (2016-05-18)
        
        The netfs library is using the lockless reference-counting primitives
        for both peropen and node objects now, and the global reference
        counting lock has been removed.
        
        The integer hashing library gained a new interface to use non-integer
        keys.  It is now used in libdiskfs' and nfs' node cache, and the ftpfs
        translator.
        
        Several bugs in our native fakeroot tool have been fixed improving
        stability and correctness of the translation.
        
        The devnode translator and the hurd-slab library have been merged into this
        repository.
        
        The code has been cleaned up, and we fixed numerous bugs, most notably
        a crash in pfinet, a locking bug in libdiskfs, and an out-of-bounds
        access in ext2fs' block cache.

    The [[**GNU Hurd**|hurd]] is the GNU project's replacement for the [[Unix]]
    kernel.  It is a collection of [[servers|hurd/translator]] that run on the
    Mach microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file access
    control, and other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or
    similar kernels (such as Linux).  More detailed: [[hurd/documentation]],
    [[hurd/what_is_the_GNU_Hurd]].

  * **GNU Mach 1.7**,
    [NEWS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/gnumach.git/tree/NEWS?id=v1.7):

        Version 1.7 (2016-05-18)
        
        The code has been updated to work with newer versions of GCC, and numerous bugs
        have been fixed throughout the code, including a pageout deadlock.  The code
        uses integer types from <stdint.h> now instead of the old Mach types.
        
        The VM cache policy change has been merged.  The kernel now caches
        unreferenced VM objects unconditionally instead of using a fixed
        limit.
        
        The physical page allocator of the X15 kernel has been integrated, and
        is now used directly by the slab allocator.  This increases the kernel
        heap addressing important scalability issues.
        
        The gsync synchronization mechanism was added, similar to the Linux kernel's
        futexes, to allow efficient and powerful userland synchronization.
        
        Support for profiling kernel code from userland through sampling was added.

    [[**GNU Mach**|microkernel/mach/gnumach]] is the GNU distribution of the
    [[Mach microkernel|microkernel/mach]], upon which a GNU Hurd system is
    based.  The [[microkernel]] provides an [[Inter Process Communication
    (IPC)|ipc]] mechanism that the Hurd uses to define interfaces for
    implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the services a
    traditional operating system kernel provides.  More detailed:
    [[microkernel/mach/documentation]].

  * **GNU MIG 1.7**,
    [NEWS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/mig.git/tree/NEWS?id=v1.7):

        Version 1.7 (2016-05-18)
        
        MIG now has a test suite.  It includes a set of valid and invalid
        definition files that MIG will try to process.  For valid
        definitions, GCC will compile the stubs to check if valid C code was
        generated.
        
        The generated code uses integer types from <stdint.h> now instead of
        the old Mach types.
        
        Code that was hard-coding the word size has been identified and
        fixed.
        
        Support for the obsolete kinds of RPC routines 'functions',
        'procedures', and 'simple procedures' has been removed.
        
        MIG now emits code that casts objects translated from capabilities
        to the correct C type.

    [[**GNU MIG**|microkernel/mach/mig/gnu_mig]] is the GNU distribution of the
    [[Mach 3.0 Interface Generator (MIG)|microkernel/mach/mig]].  This tool
    translates [[Remote Procedure Call (RPC)|rpc]] definition files to C code,
    and is required to compile any packages that are receiving or invoking
    RPCs, such as GNU Mach, GNU Hurd, and the GNU C Library (glibc) when
    compiled for the Hurd.  More detailed:
    [[microkernel/mach/mig/documentation]].

  * **glibc-2.19-hurd+libpthread-20160518**

    Based on the [[glibc]] 2.19 release, we include additional changes for GNU
    Hurd support, and bundle GNU Hurd's [[libpthread]].

    The [[**GNU C Library** (glibc)|glibc]] implements a system's standard
    library functions (as described by ISO C, and POSIX, for example).  An
    important part of the Hurd actually resides in glibc: here, the system
    interfaces are implemented on top of the [[Hurd IPC
    protocols|hurd/interface]].  This is different to the Linux port, where
    most simple system interfaces are in fact simply forwarded to/implemented
    as [[system_call]]s.

Many thanks to all the people who are helping!

If you want to give the Hurd a try, you may easily do so with [[Debian
GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]].

The GNU Hurd system currently runs on 32-bit x86 machines.  To compile the
Hurd, you need a toolchain configured to target `i?86-gnu`; you cannot use a
toolchain targeting GNU/Linux.

Please read the [[FAQ]].
Bug reports should be sent to [[mailing_lists/bug-hurd]] or filed on
<http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=hurd>.  Requests for assistance
should be sent to [[mailing_lists/help-hurd]] or filed on
<http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group=hurd>.  You can also find us on
the Freenode IRC network in the [[#hurd|IRC]] channel.
