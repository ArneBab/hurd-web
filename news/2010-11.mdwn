A month of the Hurd: *a short one*.

That's a short one.  Apart from the regular business of having internal design
/ development / etc. discussions, and helping people to get their Hurd systems
running, we had Diego Nieto Cid post patches
([1](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-11/msg00019.html),
[2](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-11/msg00023.html)) to
correct two programming errors, which Samuel Thibault quickly reviewed and
applied to the [[source repositories]].
