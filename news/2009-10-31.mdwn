> This month Philip Charles created a new [installation
> CD](http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports-cd/current/), the [L
> series](http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports-cd/hurd-i386/L1/README-L1-disc-set),
> for the Hurd, which brings us a big step towards installing the Hurd from the
> Hurd (without the need of a Linux-based installer).  If you enjoy testing
> stuff, please give it a try.

> On the same front, Michael Banck uploaded a new version of
> [crosshurd](http://packages.debian.org/sid/crosshurd) that makes it again
> possible to use this package for creating a GNU/Hurd system image directly
> from Debian unstable packages.

> Also, Thomas Schwinge migrated Sergiu Ivanov's [[hurd/translator/nsmux]],
> [[FlÃ¡vio Cruz|flaviocruz]]' cl-hurd *(clisp bindings)*, and Carl Fredrik
> Hammar [[hurd/libchannel]] repositories into our new [*incubator* Git
> repository](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/incubator.git/), making
> them easier to access for other contributors.

> Our bunch of porters continued to make further Debian packages usable on
> GNU/Hurd: Pino Toscano worked on a lot of packages, and Wesley W. Terpstra
> made [mlton](http://packages.debian.org/sid/mlton) build -- together with
> Samuel Thibault, who first had to enhance [[GNU
> Mach|microkernel/mach/gnumach]] to support allocating more than 1 GiB of RAM
> to one user-space process, which mlton needs.

> On the go, Samuel also fixed a number of other bugs here and there, for
> example together with Eric Blake and Roland McGrath hashed out a difficile
> issue in the filesystem servers regarding POSIX conformance and system
> stability.
