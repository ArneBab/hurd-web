> This month saw bugs dying as they met hackers like [Jérémie,
> Samuel](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-03/msg00027.html), or
> [Zheng,
> Thomas](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-03/msg00051.html), or
> [Jakub](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-03/msg00071.html)
> (keeping it to a few ones which were discussed on the [[bug-hurd mailing
> list|mailing_lists/bug-hurd]]).

> Olaf, Thomas and Fredrik
> [wrote](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-03/msg00022.html) and
> submitted our [[community/gsoc/organization_application]] for the Google
> Summer of Code 2010.  However, Google is [asking most GNU projects to work
> under the GNU project
> umbrella](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-03/msg00125.html),
> so we aren't listed as an organization on our own, but instead will again
> participate as a subproject of GNU.

> Anyway, this organizational detail is not at all important for interested
> students; you can apply for any of the ideas that are listed on our
> [[community/gsoc/project_ideas]] page (or come up with your own ideas, of
> course!) via the [GNU project GSoC
> page](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject). If
> you apply, please also include the information we're asking for on our
> [[community/gsoc/student_application_form]].  Don't hesitate to
> [[contact_us]] beforehand, if there are any questions.  We're looking forward
> to seeing your applications, please send them in [before
> 2010-04-09](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs#timeline)!
