Finally, the transition from the stdio-based GLibC Application
Binary Interface (ABI) to the libio-based GLibC ABI has been
completed.  The Debian GNU/Hurd binary distribution has resumed
building packages again, and everything should be back to normal.
Note that we have also switched to <A
HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.1/">GCC 3.1</A> as our default
compiler.  Thanks to everyone who helped in making all this possible,
and our apologize for any inconvenience we have caused you.
