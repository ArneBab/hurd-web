GNU/LinuxTag 2003 is now over and since there was a talk given about
the Hurd, a demo GNU/Hurd machine running and the sale of Hurd
t-shirts, Wolfgang J&auml;hrling decided to write a <A
HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-hurd/2003-07/msg00029.html">short

J&auml;hrling, Volker Dormeyer and Michael Banck!
