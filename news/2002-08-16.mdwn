The Hurd sources have stabilized again after a short period in
which some of the interfaces were changed to prepare support of long
files.  All relevant filesystem and I/O interfaces have been modified
to use 64 bit even on 32 bit systems.

In light of the small and patient user base, we decided to drop
backwards compatibility and replace the interfaces instead extending
them.  This means that the binaries of the Hurd, the C library, and
some other programs need to be replaced manually, all at the same
time, followed by a reboot.

step-by-step procedure how to upgrade</A> Debian GNU/Hurd is available
on the Debian web site.

People not using a binary distribution need to do a full manual
bootstrap.  It is recommended to treat this as a cross-compilation
case.
