The tarball for Debian GNU/Hurd that Marcus Brinkmann made over the
years has been discontinued in favour of Jeff Bailey's

To install Debian GNU/Hurd from now on, this package should be used.
Another Debian system is required to be installed on the same machine.
The GNU/Hurd installation guide has not been updated yet.
