Neal Walfield has submitted a paper to
[[community/meetings/EuroSys_2009]] describing how resource management
is done in [[microkernel/viengoos]]:

[Viengoos: A Framework for Stakeholder-Directed Resource
Allocation](http://walfield.org/papers/2009-walfield-viengoos-a-framework-for-stakeholder-directed-resource-allocation.pdf).

> General-purpose operating systems not only fail to provide adaptive
> applications the information they need to intelligently adapt, but also
> schedule resources in such a way that were applications to aggressively
> adapt, resources would be inappropriately scheduled.  The problem is that
> these systems use demand as the primary indicator of utility, which is a poor
> indicator of utility for adaptive applications.

> We present a resource management framework appropriate for traditional as
> well as adaptive applications.  The primary difference from current
> schedulers is the use of stakeholder preferences in addition to demand.  We
> also show how to revoke memory, compute the amount of memory available to
> each principal, and account shared memory.  Finally, we introduce a prototype
> system, Viengoos, and present some benchmarks that demonstrate that it can
> efficiently support multiple aggressively adaptive applications
> simultaneously.
