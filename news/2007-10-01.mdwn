This year the GNU Hurd had again been assigned one slot within the **Google
Summer of Code** program, which was assigned to the task **design and implement
[*libchannel*](http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?1619), a library for streams**.
Carl Fredrik Hammar has been working on this task and recently [posted a
summary](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2007-09/msg00009.html)
about the successful work he had been doing, but also gave an outline about how
he intends to continue improving and extending it.
