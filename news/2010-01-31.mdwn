> This month saw the first booting version of an

> which seconds the distribution from 
> [Debian](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/) 
> which already gives you 66% of the debian software archive.
> 
> Also we organized a meeting at FOSDEM, February 6th and 7th in Bruxelles, where 
> [8 Hurd developers will meet](http://www.bddebian.com/~hurd-web/community/meetings/fosdem_2010/). 
> Six of us will stay in Hotel Astrid with the FSFE folks. 
> On Sunday 7th, Olaf Buddenhagen will be giving two presentations in the 
> [Alt-OS Devroom](http://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/FOSDEM2010AltOSDevroomSchedule): 
> *Why is Anyone Still Working on the GNU Hurd?* (10:30)
> and *Porting KGI graphics drivers from Linux to GNU Hurd* (13:00).
> 
> And Carl Fredrik Hammar 
> [finished and presented](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-01/msg00078.html) 
> his thesis 
> [``Generalizing mobility for the Hurd''](http://users.student.lth.se/cs07fh9/2009-hammar-hurd-mobility.pdf)
> and passed with distinction. Its abstract reads:  
> *The GNU Hurd features mobile objects
> in its implementation of filesystem backing stores.
> This thesis investigates the
> limitations and security concerns
> these objects present,
> and how they can be overcome.
> This is done in preparation for new applications
> that feature mobile code and mobile objects.
> In addition,
> one such application is studied and implemented,
> in which mobile code is used to make
> the ioctl system call more extensible.*
