> The Arch Hurd folks keep [making good
> progress](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-hurd/2010-04/msg00003.html):
> their count of available packages keeps increasing, and one of their team
> reported the first instance of Arch Hurd [running on real
> hardware](http://www.archhurd.org/news/11) (and uploaded [a
> photo](http://wiki.archhurd.org/wiki/User:Giselher#ArchHurd_on_a_real_PC) as
> evidence).

> Of course, our Debian port is still progressing, too: 66% of all Debian
> packages [are currently available for Debian
> GNU/Hurd](https://buildd.debian.org/stats/hurd-i386.txt).

> *Samuel Thibault*'s fix got included in libxcb1, so X.org again [works out of
> the box](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/04/msg00034.html) using a
> simple `startx`.

> *Philip Charles* [extended his
> offerings](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/04/msg00019.html) with an
> updated *GRUB USB stick for booting Debian GNU/Hurd*.

> *Carl Fredrik Hammar* proposed a patch to [faciliate debugging the startup of
> misbehaving
> translators](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-04/msg00037.html).

> Mainly thanks to *Jose Luis Alarcon Sanchez*, we now have a [new QEMU
> image](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/04/msg00098.html).  It can be
> run with a simple `qemu -hda debian-hurd-17042010-qemu.img`.

> *Thomas Schwinge* updated [our glibc maintenance
> repository](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/glibc.git/?h=tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker)
> to a recent version, including a bunch of the patches from the Debian glibc
> package (and these are meant to eventually be submitted upstream).  After a
> long break, he as well
> [updated](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-04/msg00062.html)
> his [[toolchain_cross-compilation_script|hurd/building/cross-compiling]] to
> the current source code packages, and added C++ support.

> On to the GSoC news: we got three students working on the Hurd this year:

>   * *Jeremie Koenig*, mentored by *Samuel Thibault*, will be working on
>     adapting the Debian Installer to [produce working Debian GNU/Hurd
>     installation
>     images](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/debian/t127230758239)
>     so we can easily offer up to date disc-sets.
>     ([Details](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/HurdDebianInstaller/JeremieKoenig).)

>   * *Emilio Pozuelo Monfort*, mentored by *Carl Fredrik Hammar* (who was a
>     GSoC student in 2007), will be working on the perceivedly boring, yet
>     extremely valuable task of [fixing compatibility problems exposed by
>     projects
>     testsuites](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759396).
>     ([[Details|community/gsoc/project_ideas/testsuites]].)  For starters, he
>     already got a glibc patch [accepted
>     upstream](http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2010-04/msg00046.html).

>   * *Karim Allah Ahmed*, mentored by *Sergio López*, will be working on
>     [tuning the VM Subsystem in
>     GNU/Hurd](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759587)
>     to bring the virtual memory management in Hurd/Mach up to date.
>     ([[Details|community/gsoc/project_ideas/vm_tuning]].)

> We'd be happy to see *YOU* sign up on our mailing lists
> ([[mailing_lists/bug-hurd]] and [[mailing_lists/debian-hurd]] are the main
> lists), and [[contribute|contributing]] towards making the Hurd usable for
> everyone, as written down in
> [[our_mission_statement|community/weblogs/antrik/hurd-mission-statement]].
> Perhaps one of the unassigned projects (outside of the Google Summer of Code
> context) from our [[project_ideas_list|community/gsoc/project_ideas]] is fit
> for you?
