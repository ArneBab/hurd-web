> This month the Arch Hurd team 
> reported the first instance of Arch Hurd 
> [running on real hardware](http://www.archhurd.org/news/11) (and uploaded
> [a photo](http://wiki.archhurd.org/wiki/User:Giselher#ArchHurd_on_a_real_PC) as evidence). 
> 
> Also the fix from *Samuel Thibault* got included in libxcb1, so X.org
> [works out of the box again](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/04/msg00034.html) with 
> a simple startx and *Philip Charles* 
> [extended his offerings](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/04/msg00019.html) 
> with an updated *GRUB usb stick for booting Debian/Hurd*.

> And mainly thanks to *Jose Luis Alarcon Sanchez* we now have a 
> [new qemu image](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/04/msg00098.html)
> Which runs out of the box via `qemu -hda debian-hurd-17042010-qemu.img`. 
> 
> Now to the GSoC news: we got 
> [3 students](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/list_projects/google/gsoc2010) 
> working on The Hurd this year: 
> 
>>  *Jeremie Koenig* mentored by *Samuel Thibault* will be working on adapting the debian-installer to 
>> [produce working Debian GNU/Hurd installation images](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/debian/t127230758239) 
>> so we can more easily offer up to date disc-sets
>> ([details](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/HurdDebianInstaller/JeremieKoenig)). 
>> 
>> Also *Emilio Pozuelo Monfort* mentored by *Fredrik Hammar* will work on the 
>> possibly boring yet extremely valuable task of 
>> [fixing compatibility problems exposed by projects testsuites](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759396)
>> ([[details|community/gsoc/project_ideas/testsuites]]). 
> 
>> And finally *Karim Ahmed* mentored by *Sergio Lopez* will work on 
>> [Tuning the VM Subsystem in GNU/Hurd](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/gnuproject/t127230759587)
>> to bring get the virtual memory management in Hurd/Mach up to date 
>> ([[details|community/gsoc/project_ideas/vm_tuning]]).
> 
> So we had quite an exiting month with many starting threads, 
> which makes this the perfect time to 
> subscribe to our [[mailing_lists]] (bug-hurd and debian-hurd are the main lists)
> and see the Hurd make another leap forward. We’d be happy to see you sign up and 
> contribute towards making the Hurd usable for everyone 
> ([[our_mission|community/weblogs/antrik/hurd-mission-statement]])!
