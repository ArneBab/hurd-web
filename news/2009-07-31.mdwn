> Samuel Thibault uploaded a new version of the hurd

> fixing a long-standing bug in the [[hurd/translator/exec]] server that had
> randomly made it hang, inhibiting the creation of new processes.

> [[Sergiu Ivanov|scolobb]] implemented most of the functionality of the
> [[union mount translator|hurd/translator/unionmount]] which allows combining
> the [[filesystem trees exported by several translators|hurd/translator]] with
> the filesystem tree of the underlying node (in contrast to a pure
> [[hurd/translator/unionfs]], which won't do that).  The patches are currently

> of Code|community/gsoc]] project, and we're happy to tell that Sergiu
> successfully passed the project's midterm evaluation.

> Also, [[Zheng Da|zhengda]] [[!GNU_Savannah_patch 6851 desc="fixed a bug"]] in GNU Mach's
> [[!wikipedia Berkeley Packet Filter desc="BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)"]]
