> Thomas Schwinge [finished

> the main Hurd, GNU Mach, MIG, libpthread and unionfs to Git.  You can find
> the new repositories at <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/>.

> Also, he made [libpthread buildable
> stand-alone](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2009-06/msg00166.html)
> by separating its build system from the Hurd's.

> Additionally Samuel Thibault uploaded a new version of the Hurd 
> [[Debian_package|hurd/running/debian]] which improves stability. 

> Last but not least Olaf Buddenhagen wrote a usability report about his experience
> with two years of using the [[GNU Hurd for everyday work|hurd/status]].
