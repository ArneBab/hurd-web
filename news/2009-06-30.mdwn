> This month Thomas Schwinge [finished
> migrating](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2009-06/msg00147.html)
> the main Hurd, GNU Mach, MIG, libpthread and unionfs to Git.  You can find
> the new repositories at <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/>.

> Also, he made [libpthread buildable
> stand-alone](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2009-06/msg00166.html)
> by separating its build system from the Hurd's.

> For this years Summer of Code [[Sergiu_Ivanov|user/scolobb]] already implemented much of the 
> core functionality of [[union_mounts|hurd/translator/unionmount]] which will allow combining 
> the filesystem trees from translators with the filesystem trees the underlying node. 

> Also Samuel Thibault uploaded a new version of the Hurd 
> [[Debian_package|hurd/running/debian]] which improves stability. 

> Additionally Zhen Da fixed a bug in Mach's 
> [BPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter)
> implementation and added fixes and 
> improvements for rpctrace which should help further debugging. 

> Last but not least Olaf Buddenhagen wrote a usability report about his experience
> with two years of using the [[GNU Hurd for everyday work|hurd/status]].
