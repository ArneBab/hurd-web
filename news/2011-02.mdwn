<!--firstoff: Just noting all changes i can make sense of :). Next step: Writing how each advances the Hurd and removing those which are hard to comprehend for newcomers.-->


* Svante Signell: [x86info](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-01/msg00030.html)
* Svante Signell [fixed dhcp](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-03/msg00017.html) with help from Samuel Thibault, bringing the Hurd [closer to full d-i support](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-03/msg00016.html). Also he [got emacs working again](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2011/01/msg00025.html), giving the Hurd a full GNU environment again and got libgc1c2 building by just [copying the symbols file](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2011/01/msg00062.html) along with fixing build problems of many other packages.
* Samuel Thibault explained how to use the live CD to install Hurd from a USB stick (but not rwrite to USB): <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-02/msg00077.html>
* And we started preparing for GSoC 2011 - if you are interested in contributing, why not drop by <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-02/msg00000.html>
* Also Etenil and others improved the help output of the crucial settrans command: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-02/msg00011.html>

And last but not least, we got [mentioned by xkcd](http://www.explainxkcd.com/2011/01/07/good-code/) as an example of writing good code (though the resolution does not really do the Hurd justice, as it ignores that it got into a state in which these news can be written in the Hurd itself, even though it has very few active developers. If you want to see how much difference *you* can make, just ask Svante).
