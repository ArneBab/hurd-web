<!--firstoff: Just noting all changes i can make sense of :). Next step: Writing how each advances the Hurd and removing those which are hard to comprehend for newcomers.-->


* During the last two months, Svante Signell ported [x86info](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-01/msg00030.html) and [fixed dhcp](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-03/msg00017.html) with help from Samuel Thibault, bringing the Hurd [closer to full d-i support](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-03/msg00016.html). Also he [got emacs working again](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2011/01/msg00025.html), giving the Hurd a full GNU environment and got libgc1c2 building by simply [copying the symbols file](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2011/01/msg00062.html) - along with fixing build problems of many other packages.

* Samuel Thibault [explained](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-02/msg00077.html) how to use the LiveCD to install Hurd from a USB stick (but not write to USB, as GNU Mach is still missing USB support) and

* the Arch Hurd folks wrote a [Year of Arch Hurd](http://www.barrucadu.co.uk/year-of-arch-hurd), wrapping up their successes, including GHAMP (GNU/Hurd, Apache, MySQL, and PHP), Xorg and their [Arch Hurd LiveCD](http://www.archhurd.org/gethurd.php#livecd).

* Also Etenil and others [improved the help output](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-02/msg00011.html) of the crucial settrans command, which is used throughout the Hurd from mounting file systems to setting up the network.

* And we started [preparing](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-02/msg00000.html) for GSoC 2011 - if you are interested in contributing, why not drop by? Many project ideas can be found at [[community/gsoc/project_ideas]].

Finally we got a nice [mention by xkcd](http://www.explainxkcd.com/2011/01/07/good-code/) as an example of writing (too) good code (though the resolution does not really do the Hurd justice, as it ignores that it got into a state in which these news can be written in the Hurd itself, even though it has very few active developers. If you want to see how much difference *you* can make, just ask Svante).
