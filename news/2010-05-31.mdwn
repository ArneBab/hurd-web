> [[Zheng_Da|user/zhengda]]
> [reported](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00037.html)
> on the state of his ongoing work of porting DDE linux26 to the Hurd, which is
> meant to improve the GNU/Hurd hardware support.  The devices as emulated by
> QEMU and VMware already work fine, but he's still seeking help for testing on
> real hardware.

> Sergio López published
> [patches](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00059.html)
> as well as [readily-usable
> packages](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00106.html)
> to prevent thread storms in ext2fs when synchronizing large pagers.  This
> should improve system performance and stability.

> Emilio Pozuelo Monfort and Sergio López developed further patches (for
> example:
> [exec](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00108.html),
> [tmpfs](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00077.html)) to
> fix or improve the various internal Hurd servers, and discussed them with
> other Hurd developers.

> Justus Winter [created a live
> CD](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00033.html) with an
> installation wizard in the spirit of the OpenBSD installer.  He needs testers
> to help improve it.

> Ludovic Courtès informed that he has added support for [cross-building
> packages from GNU/Linux to
> GNU/Hurd](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00105.html)
> to the Nix package manager, as well as doing [continuous cross-building of
> the GNU Hurd
> itself](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00111.html),
> and [glibc](http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2010-05/msg00049.html).

> The [[regular IRC meetings|irc#regular_meetings]] for [[Google Summer of Code
> students|community/gsoc]], their mentors, and any other interested parties
> [are
> continuing](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-05/msg00148.html)
> on Mondays and Thursdays, 10:30 UTC, as Olaf Buddenhagen reported.  If you
> want to catch up, have a look at the [#hurd channel
> logs](http://richtlijn.be/~larstiq/hurd/).

> As always in the *Month of the Hurd*, these news blurbs are only a selection
> of what happened in the last month.  There's always more to be found on our
