> This month Jérémie Koenig got the 
> [Debian installer (d-i) for the Hurd](http://jk.fr.eu.org/debian/hurd-installer/) into
> basic working state with a simple 
> [4 step installation guide](http://jk.fr.eu.org/debian/hurd-installer/README.txt)
>  ([status mail](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-07/msg00158.html)). 
> This gets us a big step towards easy installation and automated image creation. 
> You can track Jérémie’s progress on his [[user_page|user/jkoenig]]. 
> 
> Also Emilio Pozuelo Monfort worked on improving the compatibility with 
> third party programs via 
> [changes to exec](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-07/msg00141.html)
> and added support to 
> [send file descriptors over Unix sockets](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-07/msg00145.html). 
> Both will help getting more packages to compile and run in the Hurd. 

> Additionally Ludovic Courtès 
> [fixed make dist](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-07/msg00098.html) 
> in console-client which allows easy tarball creation for uploading to ftp.gnu.org.

> And the Hurd got onto bigger newssites again. First with an article focussing on failures 
> [in the H](http://www.h-online.com/open/features/GNU-HURD-Altered-visions-and-lost-promise-1030942.html) and 
> [heise (german)](http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/GNU-HURD-Veraenderte-Visionen-und-verworfene-Versprechen-1046753.html) 
> and then with a 
> [well researched article in LWN](http://lwn.net/Articles/395150/).
