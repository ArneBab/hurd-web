[[!meta title="2011-04-01: GNU/Hurd 0.401 is released!"]]

We'd like to pass on these marvelous news from our Release Management
Team, headed by Release Manager Samuel Thibault:

> Hello,
> 
> There are rumors that Duke Nukem Forever will actually be released in
> Apr^WMa^WJune 2011, so there's no escape for the Hurd any more, we had
> to finish and release. There has been considerable progress lately,
> so it is with great pleasure that the Hurd maintainers team decided
> to release *version 0.401 of the GNU/Hurd Operating System*. As the
> version number and image size suggest, this is only a small preview
> of course, but we expect GNU/Hurd to be of production-quality within
> the third millenium, to be sure.
> 
> A *LiveCD demo* is available on
> <http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-0.401/hurd-0.401.iso>
> and can be trivially tried using
> `qemu -cdrom hurd-0.401.iso`
> 
> We hope that you will appreciate its features and speed.
> 
> Are you interested in contributing to the GNU Hurd project?  Just
