There is a new mailing list called <A
HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/hurd-devel-readers">
Hurd-devel-readers</A>. It is the read-only version of Hurd-devel.
<P>
Hurd-devel is a mailing list for detailed discussions
of design and implementation issues in the GNU&nbsp;Hurd; it is an internal
low-volume list restricted to the core developers of the Hurd.  While
the <A HREF="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/hurd-devel/">web-based
archive of Hurd-devel</A> has always been public, the new mailing list
Hurd-devel-readers provides a convenient way to follow
the discussion of the Hurd experts.
<P>
If you are a recipient of Hurd-devel-readers and want
to follow up on the discussion, please reply to the
Bug-hurd mailing list.
