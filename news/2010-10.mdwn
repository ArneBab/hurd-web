A bit of bug fixing has bee going on:

Samuel Thibault taught [[GNU Mach|microkernel/mach/gnumach]] that Intel Pentium
4 and Opteron-class CPUs [are not just
i386](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/commit-hurd/2010-10/msg00021.html), but
in fact a bit more advanced.  Not only does this help GNU Mach to select
optimized code paths, but this information is also propagated to the user
space, and used for the `uname` command, for example.

Pino Toscano continued [fixing bugs in the socket-related glibc code and Hurd's
pfinet](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-10/msg00017.html).

After finding out that our `pread` implementation does not conform to the POSIX
standard in one aspect, Manuel Menal analyzed this, and [posted a
patch](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-10/msg00056.html).

Alexey Kuznetsov [privided IPv6 raw socket
fixes](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/commit-hurd/2010-10/msg00028.html) for
[[hurd/translator/pfinet]].

Michael Banck [uploaded a new version of
crosshurd](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/commit-hurd/2010-10/msg00006.html)
to keep up with recent packaging and dependency changes.

Samuel Thibault uploaded [[hurd/translator/gopherfs]] packages [to the Debian
repository](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/10/msg00018.html).  He
also [enabled IPv6 support for Debian Installer
installations](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/commit-hurd/2010-10/msg00034.html).

Thomas Schwinge:

As of two days later, the machine was
[re-installed](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-10/msg00011.html).
