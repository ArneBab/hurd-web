> Neal Walfield and Michael Bank have been doing presentations related to the
> GNU Hurd: from the GNU Hackers Meeting in the Hague you can watch the
> {{$community/meetings/ghm2010#walfield_hurd}} where he details why we're
> still interested in working on the GNU Hurd, and there is another
> {{$community/meetings/debconf10#banck_hurd}} from DebConf10, including a very
> nice nod towards the main actors who are currently pushing the Hurd forward.

> Jérémie Koenig wrapped up his Google Summer of Code project ([[Debian
> Installer|jkoenig]]) by posting his [*Hurd patches for
> installer/build*](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/08/threads.html#00016)
> as well as the [*patches used for hurd
> 20100802-1~jk7*](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2010/08/threads.html#00022)
> to the [[mailing_lists/debian-hurd]] mailing list.  Most of them have been
> handled in the mean time, and we're still waiting for *you* to test his work
> by following his easy [four-step
> instructions](http://jk.fr.eu.org/debian/hurd-installer/README.txt).

> However, even though that [[this year's GSoC|community/gsoc]] has come
> to an end, he didn't stop working: among other things, he has rewritten
> [[hurd/translator/procfs]] and [published his
> version](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00165.html)
> just before the end of the month:
> 
> > I have successfully tested it with most of the Linux procps utilities,
> > as well as busybox and htop. It seems to be stable, not too slow, and 
> > it stays under 1.5M in resident size.
> 
> Testing it is as simple as this:
> 
>     $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/hurd/procfs.git
>     $ cd procfs/
>     $ git checkout jkoenig/master
>     $ make
>     $ settrans -ca proc procfs --compatible
>     $ ls -l proc/

> Thomas Schwinge [added some more
> information](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00066.html)
> to the web pages, notably a bunch of [[service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663]] reports, to have them
> registered in a generic place, and to facilitate coordination.  If you're
> looking for a Hurd-related project to work on, go looking
> [[there|service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663]]!  He also converted and merged some of the [hurdextras
> CVS repositories](http://www.nongnu.org/hurdextras/) into the [hurd Git
> repositories](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd) and our
> [incubator](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/incubator.git/refs/).  All
> of this should make it easier for new contributors to join in.

> The [[hurd/running/Arch_Hurd]] guys have some news to share, too:
> 
>   * They reported on their [current status](http://www.archhurd.org/news/17),
>     as well as they [released a new LiveCD
>     image](http://www.barrucadu.co.uk/arch-hurd-livecd-i686-core-2010-08-25iso),
>     and added a [Planet Arch Hurd](http://planet.archhurd.org/) which
>     aggregates the different Arch Hurd Blogs.
> 
>   * The team [packaged everything](http://www.archhurd.org/news/18/) you need
>     for the [[faq/GHAMP]] solution stack.
> 
>   * Their Diego Nieto Cid sent a patch series to [*bring console-driver-xkb
>     up to
>     date*](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/threads.html#00012).
>     This is a add-on to allow using X keymaps to configure the [[Hurd
>     console|hurd/console]] for non-US keyboard layouts.

> Finally, amongst other bug fixing and other development work by the usual
> suspects, we had a short review of what the current Hurd contributors [[still
> need|community/weblogs/ArneBab/what_we_need]] to use a GNU/Hurd system for
> most of their day-to-day tasks.  This may help to prioritize the development
> efforts.
