Presentations (GHM DebConf10) procfs buildsystem hurdextras ArchHurd xkb what-we-need

Jeremie Koenig: [procfs rewrite](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00165.html): I have successfully tested it with most of the Linux procps utilities,
as well as busybox and htop. It seems to be stable, not too slow, and it
stays under 1.5M in resident size. To get and test it:

    git clone http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/hurd.git
    cd hurd
    git remote add jk git://github.com/jeremie-koenig/hurd.git
    git fetch jk
    git checkout jk/procfs  # Add "-b procfs" to create a local branch.
    make procfs
    settrans -ag /proc procfs/procfs --compatible
    # you now have your new procfs setup for your user

<!--note: this shows off the ease with which you can test deeper changes in the Hurd, so I think it warrants the space it gets.-->

Jeremie Koenig: Fix and cleanup the buildsystem: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00105.html

Thomas Schwinge: [added more information](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00066.html) into the wiki, notably open issues, to facilitate coordination, and started converting [hurdextras cvs repositories ]() into the [hurd git repos]() and the [incubator repository]().

Diego Nieto Cid brought the console-driver-xkb up to date for [Arch Hurd](http://archhurd.org) http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00012.html

Also Arch Hurd [released a new LiveCD](http://www.archhurd.org/news/17) ([changes](http://www.barrucadu.co.uk/arch-hurd-livecd-i686-core-2010-08-25iso)) which is a lot more stable that the previous one (including a more stable X, now at Xorg 1.9!), added a [Planet Arch Hurd](http://planet.archhurd.org/) which aggregates the Arch Hurd Blogs and packaged everything you need for a [HAMP](http://www.archhurd.org/news/18/) system: Hurd, Apache, MySQL and PHP. Besides: You can now [flattr](http://flattr.com/thing/44395/Arch-Hurd) Arch Hurd, if you want to support the project. 

Neal presented the Hurd at the [GHM (GNU Hackers' Meeting) in denhaag](http://www.gnu.org/ghm/2010/denhaag/) ([video: It’s About Freedom (Or Why you should care)](http://audio-video.gnu.org/video/ghm2010/GNU-Hurd_-_Its_About_Freedom,_Or_Why_you_should_care.ogv)). 

Also Michael Bank presented Debian GNU/Hurd [at the DebConf10](http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/events/595.en.html): ([slides: “Past. Present. And Future?”](http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/attachments/159_debian-hurd.pdf), [recording](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2010/debconf10/high/1117_Debian_GNUHurd.ogv)). 

(further [[media_appearances]] of the Hurd)

Review of what the current Hurd contributors [still need](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00029.html) to use the Hurd for most of their day-to-day tasks with [summary](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00087.html).
