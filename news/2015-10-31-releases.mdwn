We're pleased to announce new releases!

  * **GNU Hurd 0.7**,
    [NEWS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/hurd.git/tree/NEWS?id=v0.7):

        Version 0.7 (2015-10-31)

        The node cache in ext2fs has been improved, generalized, and moved to
        libdiskfs.  It is now also used by isofs and fatfs.

        The native fakeroot tool has been greatly improved.  It now handles
        named sockets, and multiple corner cases related to permissions were
        identified and fixed.

        A new utility `rpcscan' has been introduced.  It scans Mach servers
        and displays the RPCs handled by the associated demuxer.

        A long-standing synchronization issue involving the filesystem
        translators, libdiskfs, and libpager has been identified and fixed.

        The code has been updated to work with newer versions of the compiler
        and libc, and numerous bugs have been fixed throughout the code.

    The [[**GNU Hurd**|hurd]] is the GNU project's replacement for the [[Unix]]
    kernel.  It is a collection of [[servers|hurd/translator]] that run on the
    Mach microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file access
    control, and other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or
    similar kernels (such as Linux).  More detailed: [[hurd/documentation]],
    [[hurd/what_is_the_GNU_Hurd]].

  * **GNU Mach 1.6**,
    [NEWS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/gnumach.git/tree/NEWS?id=v1.6):

        Version 1.6 (2015-10-31)
        
        The code has been updated to work with newer versions of the compiler,
        and numerous bugs have been fixed throughout the code.
        
        The lock debugging infrastructure has been revived and improved, and
        many locking issues have been fixed.
        
        The IPC tables and the hash table mapping objects to IPC entries have
        been replaced by radix trees.  This addresses a scalability issue, as
        IPC tables required huge amounts of continuous virtual kernel memory.
        
        The kernel now allows non-privileged users to wire a small amount of
        memory.
        
        A bug hindering the eviction of inactive pages by the pageout daemon
        has been identified and fixed.
        
        The kernel now keeps timestamps relative to the system boot time.
        Among other things this fixes bogus uptime readings if the system time
        is altered.
        
        A reference leak in the exception handling mechanism has been
        identified and fixed.
        
        ANSI escape sequences are now handled when using `printf'.  This fixes
        the formatting of messages printed by various Linux drivers.

    [[**GNU Mach**|microkernel/mach/gnumach]] is the GNU distribution of the
    [[Mach microkernel|microkernel/mach]], upon which a GNU Hurd system is
    based.  The [[microkernel]] provides an [[Inter Process Communication
    (IPC)|ipc]] mechanism that the Hurd uses to define interfaces for
    implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the services a
    traditional operating system kernel provides.  More detailed:
    [[microkernel/mach/documentation]].

  * **GNU MIG 1.6**,
    [NEWS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/mig.git/tree/NEWS?id=v1.6):

        Version 1.6 (2015-10-31)
        
        * MIG now emits RPC lookup functions that are declared `static inline'
          improving compatibility with newer dialects of C.

    [[**GNU MIG**|microkernel/mach/mig/gnu_mig]] is the GNU distribution of the
    [[Mach 3.0 Interface Generator (MIG)|microkernel/mach/mig]].  This tool
    translates [[Remore Procedure Call (RPC)|rpc]] definition files to C code,
    and is required to compile any packages that are receiving or invoking
    RPCs, such as GNU Mach, GNU Hurd, and the GNU C Library (glibc) when
    compiled for the Hurd.  More detailed:
    [[microkernel/mach/mig/documentation]].

    The [[**GNU C Library** (glibc)|glibc]] implements a system's standard
    library functions (as described by ISO C, and POSIX, for example).  An
    important part of the Hurd actually resides in glibc: here, the system
    interfaces are implemented on top of the [[Hurd IPC
    protocols|hurd/interface]].  This is different to the Linux port, where
    most simple system interfaces are in fact simply forwarded to/implemented
    as [[system_call]]s.

Many thanks to all the people who are helping!

If you want to give the Hurd a try, you may easily do so with [[Debian
GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]].

The GNU Hurd system currently runs on 32-bit x86 machines.  To compile the
Hurd, you need a toolchain configured to target `i?86-gnu`; you cannot use a
toolchain targeting GNU/Linux.

Please read the [[FAQ]].
Bug reports should be sent to [[mailing_lists/bug-hurd]] or filed on
<http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=hurd>.  Requests for assistance
should be sent to [[mailing_lists/help-hurd]] or filed on
<http://savannah.gnu.org/support/?group=hurd>.  You can also find us on
the Freenode IRC network in the [[#hurd|IRC]] channel.
