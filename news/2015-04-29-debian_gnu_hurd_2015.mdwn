It is with huge pleasure that the Debian GNU/Hurd team announces the
**release of Debian GNU/Hurd 2015**.

This is a snapshot of Debian "sid" at the time of the stable Debian
"jessie" release (April 2015), so it is mostly based on the same
sources. It is not an official Debian release, but it is an official
[[Debian GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] port release.

The **GNU Hurd** is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.  It is a
collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file
systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are
implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).  [[More
detailed|hurd/documentation]].

**GNU Mach** is the microkernel upon which a GNU Hurd system is based.  It
provides an Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that the Hurd uses to
define interfaces for implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the
services a traditional operating system kernel provides.  [[More
detailed|microkernel/mach/gnumach]].
