Good day.

I am a developer, have some c knowledge, and in perspective hope to be able to make a contribution in Hurd kernel. At the moment I consider myself as a beginner.

My question is about the second exercise.

>Implement your own pager. Write a server that synthesizes content on the fly and have a client map the object into its address space and print out the file.

* The second sentence "Write a server that..." is too long and too difficult for me to understand perhaps because English is not my native language. Could you please explain it in a little bit easier phrases?
* Am I write that in a given context "pager" means just "memory manager"?
