IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-07-26:

    < antrik> Tekk_`: regarding microkernels: the basic idea, and really the
      *only* fundamental difference, is that they isolate things in separate
      address spaces. everything else goes back to this.
    < antrik> benefits from the isolation generally fall into two groups: more
      robustness (main focus of Minix3), and more flexibility (main focus of
      Hurd)
    < antrik> while it might also encourage some other good design choices,
      these are secondary effects: such choices can also be implemented in a
      monolithic architecture -- and not necessarily harder. just less obvious
      in some cases...
