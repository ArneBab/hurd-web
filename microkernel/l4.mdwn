The [*L4* microkernel](http://l4ka.org/) is an attempt to create a very small
high performace core which provides basic memory management, task and context

See [l4.verified](http://nicta.com.au/research/projects/l4.verified) for work
on formally verifying an L4 microkernel.

There was a GNU/Hurd [[history/port_to_L4]], which is now stalled.
