GNU Mach is currently used by the GNU [[Hurd]].

GNU Mach remains compatible with Mach 3.0.

The majority of GNU Mach's device drivers are from Linux 2.0.  They were
added using glue code, i.e., a Linux emulation layer in Mach.

GNU Mach runs on x86 machines.  See the
[[hardware_compatibility_list|hardwarecompatibilitylist]] and information about
[[ports]] to other architectures.
