A `task_set_name` RPC has been added to GNU Mach.  Before, the Mach debugger
looked for `arg[0]` on the stack using ugly heuristics (see
`gnumach/i386/i386/db_interface.c`, `looks_like_command`...).  Now we can let
`exec` simply set the name and record it in `task_t`.  After adding the RPC,
glibc needs to be recompiled against the updated `mach.defs` to get access to
it from userland, and exec would probably call it from `hurd/exec/exec.c`,
`do_exec()`.  Also see the discussion on
[[open_issues/translate_fd_or_port_to_file_name]].
