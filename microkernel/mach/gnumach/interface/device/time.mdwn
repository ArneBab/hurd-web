The *mapped-time interface*, that is, a `mmap`able read-only memory page
containing a `struct mapped_time_value`.  See the [[reference_manual]].

Typically available as `/dev/time`, [[hurd/translator/storeio]].

Using that, [[hurd/libshouldbeinlibc]]'s `<maptime.h>` provides `maptime_map`
and `maptime_read`, see the [[hurd/reference_manual]].  Candidate for
replacement with [[open_issues/vDSO]] code?
