    <braunr> youpi: what would you think of adding a debug-related syscall to
      gnumach so that we have a printf-like tool even in situations where the
      code can't perform an rpc (i.e. glibc)
    <youpi> could be useful indeed
    <youpi> I've found myself having a hard time making some printfs from odd
      places of glibc :)
    <braunr> i also suggest we make it unprivileged
    <youpi> not enabled by default then
    <youpi> otherwise it's an easy DoS
    <braunr> well, for now, we don't care much about DoS, but we do care about
      debugging
    <braunr> at least until the very core issues we have are understood and
      resolved
    <youpi> I usually frown on debugging feature being too open
    <braunr> me too
    <youpi> you would always forget dropping one
    <braunr> that's why i didn't suggest it earlier
    <braunr> but i'm wasting too much time finding other decently effective
      ways

    <braunr> youpi: how about we build this debugging system call in debugging
      versions only ?
    <braunr> i suppose you already use such versions for buildds anyway
    <braunr> MACH_DEBUG is always enabled
    <braunr> the debugging version only adds --enable-kdb if i'm right
    <pinotree> check debian/rules
    <braunr> that, and -fno-omit-frame-pointer

    <braunr> youpi: concerning gnumach, i've added a mach_print system call,
      with one argument (a null terminated string) to -dbg kernels
      (--enable-kbd)
    <youpi> k
    <braunr> if it's fine with you, i'll commit it too
    <youpi> I'm fine
