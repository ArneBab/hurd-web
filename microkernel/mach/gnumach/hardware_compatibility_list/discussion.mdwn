    <braunr> youpi: concerning the ide compatibility problem, it seems some
      bioses provide several modes
    <braunr> youpi: "legacy ide" and "native ide"
    <braunr> i don't know what native ide really means, but when debugging ide
      probing in gnumach, it just looks like there is nothing to detect
    <braunr> and even in this mode, linux uses the ahci driver
    <youpi> apparently native means it still uses the IDE protocol, but
      possibly with other IRQs
    <youpi> i.e. you need a PCI driver to handle that
    <braunr> ok

    <teythoon> i bought a new mainboard for my hurd box
    <teythoon> a ga-e350n
    <teythoon> everything looks fine, grub loads gnumach, and, (afaict) it
      starts it, but i see no single line printed by gnumach
    <teythoon> the thing is, that this is the second board of this kind that i
      bought
    <teythoon> and on the first one, gnumach did work just fine
    <teythoon> i tried it with a live cd, the same cd worked on the first
      board, but does not on the second
    <teythoon> also, i'm kind of surprised to see nothing at all from gnumach
    <teythoon> i mean, it's loaded by grub
    <youpi> teythoon: you could try to put *(char*)0xb8000 = 'X' starting from
      c_boot_entry
    <youpi> just to see at least something
    <teythoon> i'll try, thanks :)
