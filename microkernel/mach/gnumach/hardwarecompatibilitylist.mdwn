# CPU Architecture

GNU Mach current only supports the `x86` architecture.  `amd64` should -- in
theory -- as well work fine in `32-bit` compatibility mode, however in practice
there are problems with the chipsets used for such processors, so that booting
on such a system won't succeed.

Support for running GNU Mach (and a complete GNU/Hurd system) in a
[Xen](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/xen/) `domU` (again on `x86`
only) is [[being_worked_on|xen]].

# Memory

GNU Mach will use a maximum of 1 GiB of RAM.  If your system has more,
the surplus will silently be ignored.  (In past times, this would hinder GNU
Mach from booting at all, but this has been fixed, so you no longer need to
apply GRUB's `uppermem` directive.)

# Video Cards

Debian distributes a version of [X.org](http://x.org/).  If your video card driver
depends on a special kernel interface such as that provided by
the `agpgart` kernel module for the Linux kernel, then your video
card will only be supported by the VESA driver.

# Sound

No sound cards are supported at this time.

# USB 1.1/2.0

USB is not supported at this time.

# IEEE 1394 (Firewire)

IEEE 1394 is not supported at this time

# Storage

Most IDE drives are known to work. Some drive geometries do not work. If you find a specific IDE drive that does not work, make a note of the model and technical specifications here.

SATA drives may work in compatibility mode.  <!-- Sure?  --[[tschwinge]] -->

# Device Drivers

[GNU Mach Reference Manual,
Configuration](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-doc/Configuration.html)
contains a list of device drivers that are included in GNU Mach and elaborates
on the hardware devices they support.

# User Success Reports

These boards are known to work. Gnumach/Hurd has been installed and run on these board successfully. 

* ASUS P2B motherboard with an Intel PII 450MHz CPU 
* Intel SE-440BX motherboard 

# User Failure Reports

These boards or hardware combination are known to fail with gnumach/Hurd.

* ASUS P5A motherboard and AMD K6-2 333MHz CPU - Debian GNU/Hurd will install but not boot on this board
* ASUS P2B-LS motherboard with an Intel PII-MMX 400 MHz CPU - this board had a defective onboard NIC and working 3COM Etherlink III NIC in a PCI bus slot. This combination worked with GNU/Linux. The 3COM NIC is known to work with the Hurd. However, while gnumach/Hurd will boot on this system, it is confused by the defective onboard NIC and unable to use the 3COM NIC. Attempting to start networking generates a continous streams of eth0 and eth1 reset messages on the console that renders the system unusable.
