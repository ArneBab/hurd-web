/!\ Since GNU Mach doesn't handle PAE yet, you'll need a PAE-disabled hypervisor.

/!\ You need an already installed GNU/Hurd system.

This also means that you'll currently need a PAE-disabled `dom0`.
[[Stefan_Siegl|stesie]] is providing a PAE-disabled Linux kernel image at
<http://brokenpipe.de/GnuHurd/XEN/>.


You can either get binaries at <http://youpibouh.thefreecat.org/hurd-xen/> or build them yourself.

- Copy `gnumach-xen` and `hurd-modules` to your dom0 /boot.
- Copy `hurd` into `/etc/xen`, edit it for fixing access to your hurd / and swap
- Run `xm create -c hurd`, gnumach should get started.
- If `xm` complains about networking (`vif could not be connected`), it's Xen scripts' fault, see Xen documentation for how to configure the network.  The simplest way is network-bridge with fixed IPs (note that you need the bridge-utils package for this).  You can also just disable networking by commenting the vif line in the config.
- If `xm` complains `Error: (2, 'Invalid kernel', 'xc_dom_compat_check: guest type xen-3.0-x86_32 not supported by xen kernel, sorry\n')`, you most probably have a PAE-enabled hypervisor, and you just need to install and boot non-PAE hypervisor and kernel.

If you want to generate these images, first get the `gnumach-1-branch-Xen-branch` branch from gnumach CVS.
Then look for "Ugly" in `kern/bootstrap.c`, how to generate `hurd-modules` is explained there, and you'll have to fix `EXT2FS_SIZE` and `LD_SO_SIZE` by hand.
Then use

    ./configure --enable-platform=xen
    make

The current `hurd-modules` was built from the debian packages `hurd 20070606-2` and `libc0.3 2.6.1-1`.
/!\ This means that when using this image, your GNU/Hurd system also needs to be a glibc version 2.6-based one!
