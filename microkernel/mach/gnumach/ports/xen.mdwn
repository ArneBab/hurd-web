## Xen dom0, PAE-disabled hypervisor

/!\ Since GNU Mach doesn't handle PAE yet, you'll need a PAE-disabled hypervisor.

On Debian Lenny, for example, you can install xen-hypervisor-3.2-1-i386-nonpae.

This also means that you'll currently need a PAE-disabled `dom0`.
[[Stefan_Siegl|stesie]] is providing a PAE-disabled Linux kernel image at
<http://brokenpipe.de/GnuHurd/XEN/>.

You can either get binaries at <http://youpibouh.thefreecat.org/hurd-xen/> or build them yourself.

- Copy `gnumach-xen` and `hurd-modules` to your dom0 /boot.
- Copy `hurd` into `/etc/xen`, edit it for fixing access to your hurd / and swap

## GNU/Hurd system

/!\ You need an already installed GNU/Hurd system.

If you have a free partition, you can fdisk to type 0x83, create a filesystem using:

    sudo mke2fs -b 4096 -I 128 -o hurd /dev/sda4 

Replace /dev/sda4 with your partition. Install and use crosshurd to setup a GNU/Hurd system on this partition.

## /etc/xen/hurd configuration

Here is a sample /etc/xen/hurd configuration

    kernel = "/boot/gnumach-xen"
    memory = 256
    disk = ['phy:sda4,hda,w']
    extra = "root=device:hd0"
    vif = [ '' ]
    ramdisk = "/boot/hurd-modules"

Suggestions about [[networking_configuration]] are available.

If you need stable MAC addresses, use a syntax like `vif = [
'mac=00:16:3e:XX:XX:XX, bridge=br0' ]`.

## Running Hurd with Xen

To run Hurd with Xen, use:

    xm create -c hurd

and gnumach should get started. Proceed with native-install.

    export TERM=mach
    ./native-install

- If `xm` complains about networking (`vif could not be connected`), it's Xen scripts' fault, see Xen documentation for how to configure the network.  The simplest way is network-bridge with fixed IPs (note that you need the bridge-utils package for this).  You can also just disable networking by commenting the vif line in the config.
- If `xm` complains `Error: (2, 'Invalid kernel', 'xc_dom_compat_check: guest type xen-3.0-x86_32 not supported by xen kernel, sorry\n')`, you most probably have a PAE-enabled hypervisor, and you just need to install and boot non-PAE hypervisor and kernel.

## Building from sources

If you want to generate these images, first get the `gnumach-1-branch-Xen-branch` branch from gnumach CVS.
Then look for "Ugly" in `kern/bootstrap.c`, how to generate `hurd-modules` is explained there, and you'll have to fix `EXT2FS_SIZE` and `LD_SO_SIZE` by hand.
Then use

    ./configure --enable-platform=xen
    make

The current `hurd-modules` was built from the debian packages `hurd 20070606-2` and `libc0.3 2.6.1-1`.
/!\ This means that when using this image, your GNU/Hurd system also needs to be a glibc version 2.6-based one!
