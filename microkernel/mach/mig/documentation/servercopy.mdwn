For IN args.  If set it...

  * removes the `__mig_deallocate` for OOL IN data, which is usually done after
    the implementation has been called;

  * adds a `boolean_t NAMESCopy` for the IN arg `NAME` to indicate whether the
    data will persist nevertheless (OOL case) or has to be copied by the
    implementation (inline case).

Cf., [[translator/exec]] server, `exec.defs`.

I.e., the IN args' memory region (OOL case) persists after the implementation
has returned.
