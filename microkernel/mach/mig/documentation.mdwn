This is a small collection of links to external documents describing the Mach Interface Generator used by GNU Mach.

# MIG and C Thread Programming

A tutorial which demonstrates the use of the C Threads library primitives in writing a multithreaded program and the use of the Mach Interface Generator (MIG) to generate remote procedure calls for interprocess communication. Like its companion tutorial, it is based on the Mach 2.5 system. However, the concepts are applicable to Mach 3.0 user level programming.

# Roots

Mig is an implementation of a subset of the Matchmaker **language**.

"Matchmaker is a language for specifying and automating the generation of multilingual interprocess communication interfaces. MIG is an interim implementation of a subset of the Matchmaker language that generates C and C++ remote procedure call interfaces for interprocess communication between Mach tasks."
