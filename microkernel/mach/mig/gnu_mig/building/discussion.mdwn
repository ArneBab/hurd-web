# Non-cross-compiling

[[!tag open_issue_mig]]

[[samuelthibault]] mentioned that I should make clear what compiler options, etc. are only needed if compiling on a 64 bit computer.  However, I don't know if the --host=i686... option is needed, here and when making gnumach, in case there may be some other default on 32 bit computers? --[[sudoman]]
