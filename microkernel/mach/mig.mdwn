The Mach Interface Generator (MIG) is an [[IDL]] compiler.  Based on an
interface definition, it creates stubs to [[invoke]] object methods
and to demultiplex incoming messages.  These stubs conveniently hide
the details of Mach's [[IPC]] machinery and make it easy to implement
and use Mach [[interface]]s as [[remote_procedure_calls_(RPC)|rpc]].
