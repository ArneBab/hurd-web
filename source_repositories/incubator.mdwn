There is a repository for *this*, and *that*, and *everything* -- the
*incubator*: <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/incubator.git/>.

As the `README` file in the `master` branch says, the development of the
various software happens in separate branches.

## Handling branches with `git-new-workdir`

`git-new-workdir` is a contrib script provided with the git distribution
(on Debian systems, in `/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/workdir/git-new-workdir`);
it allows to create a new subrepository of a git repository, tracking one of
its branches, usually as a subdirectory of the current repository.

The advantage of using it for `incubator` is that only one clone is needed,
and it can be possible to work simultaneously on many branches (instead of
only on the current branch of that clone).
The drawback is that updating a subrepository requires updating its branch
on the main clone first.

Let's start checking out the `incubator` repository:

    $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/hurd/incubator.git
    $ cd incubator/

Assuming we now want to follow the development of the `tarfs/master` branch:
we follow this branch:

    $ git branch -t tarfs/master origin/tarfs/master

Then now setup a local subrepository `tarfs` following it; we will create it
as subdirectory of `incubator` (first parameter for `git-new-workdir`) for
simplicity, but can be created anywhere else:

    $ git-new-workdir . tarfs tarfs/master

After this, a new `tarfs` subdirectory appears, which represents the
`tarfs/master` branch.  You can normally work on this new repository as usual.

As said earlier, updating `tarfs` requires fetching/pulling in `incubator`
first:

    $ cd incubator/
    incubator$ git pull/fetch
    incubator$ cd tarfs/
    tarfs$ git pull/fetch
