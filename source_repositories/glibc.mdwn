There is a repository for maintenance of [[/glibc]] for the Hurd's needs:
<http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/glibc.git/>.  It's mainly used for
testing glibc's master branch, but with all the patches that we need on top of
it, and also for development and sharing of (Hurd-specific) glibc patches.

This repository uses [[TopGit]].

History: *A plan for the Hurd-specific glibc repository*, [[!message-id
"878wbp81ed.fsf@dirichlet.schwinge.homeip.net"]].


# Relation to Debian glibc

For a lot of topic branches there is a correspondence to a Debian glibc patch,
and vice-versa, which is also indicated by the Debian glibc patch files' names.

Debian glibc is based on EGLIBC 2.13 and the Savannah hurd/glibc.git one is
tracking sourceware master.

The Savannah hurd/glibc.git one does not/not yet include
[[libpthread|open_issues/libpthread]], [[service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663/packaging_libpthread]].


# Usage

## Clone

    $ git init
    $ git remote add savannah git://git.sv.gnu.org/hurd/glibc.git
    $ git remote update
    $ tg remote --populate savannah
    tg: Remote savannah can now follow TopGit topic branches.
    tg: Populating local topic branches from remote 'savannah'...
    From git://git.sv.gnu.org/hurd/glibc
     * [new branch]      refs/top-bases/t/_dl_random -> savannah/top-bases/t/_dl_random
     * [new branch]      refs/top-bases/t/accept4 -> savannah/top-bases/t/accept4
    [...]
     * [new branch]      refs/top-bases/tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker -> savannah/top-bases/tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker

    tg: Adding branch tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker...
    tg: The remote 'savannah' is now the default source of topic branches.

## Use tschwinge's Working Branch

    $ git checkout tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker

## Integrate a New Branch

A new (TopGit) branch has been published upstream:

    $ tg remote --populate savannah
    tg: Remote savannah can now follow TopGit topic branches.
    tg: Populating local topic branches from remote 'savannah'...
    remote: Counting objects: 28, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (19/19), done.
    remote: Total 20 (delta 13), reused 1 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (20/20), done.
    From git://git.sv.gnu.org/hurd/glibc

# Maintenance

## Tags

Occasionally push new tags from the sourceware repository to the Savannah one:

    $ git fetch sourceware
    $ git tag | grep ^glibc- | sed 's%^%tag %' | xargs git push savannah

    <braunr> is it ok to store several patches in one topgit branch ?
    <braunr> or is it really designed for one patch per branch ?
    <braunr> fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/youpi/tls-threadvar': unknown
      revision or path not in the working tree.
    <braunr> tschwinge: ^
    <braunr> tschwinge: does that ring a bell ?
    <tschwinge> braunr: When/how did that happen?
    <tschwinge> Has the branch been removed from the origin remote?
    <tschwinge> Yes, has been deleted (on Savannah) on 2013-09-22.
    <tschwinge> Are you somehow referencing that branch?
    <braunr> tschwinge: tg remote --populate origin
    <tschwinge> braunr: Then I'd guess that Samuel has removed that branch but
      it is still referenced in some other branch's .topdeps file.  I'll have a
      look (but don't hold your breath.)
    <braunr> tschwinge: sure
