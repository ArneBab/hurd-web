The GNU Hurd is under active development.  Because of that, there is no
*stable* version.  We distribute the Hurd sources only through CVS at present.

Although it is possible to bootstrap the GNU/Hurd system from the sources by
cross-compiling and installing the system software and the basic applications,
this is a difficult process.  It is not recommended that you do this.  Instead,
you should get a binary distribution of the GNU/Hurd, which comes with all the
GNU software precompiled and an installation routine which is easy to use.

The Debian project has commited to provide such a binary distribution.
[[Debian_GNU/Hurd|running/debian]] is currently under development and available
in the *unstable* branch of the Debian archive.
