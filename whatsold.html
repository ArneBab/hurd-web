<DT>16 August 2002</DT>
<DD>The Hurd sources have stabilized again after a short period in
which some of the interfaces were changed to prepare support of long
files.  All relevant filesystem and I/O interfaces have been modified
to use 64 bit even on 32 bit systems.

In light of the small and patient user base, we decided to drop
backwards compatibility and replace the interfaces instead extending
them.  This means that the binaries of the Hurd, the C library, and
some other programs need to be replaced manually, all at the same
time, followed by a reboot.

A <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/extra-files/hurd-upgrade.txt">detailed
step-by-step procedure how to upgrade</A> Debian GNU/Hurd is available
on the Debian web site.

People not using a binary distribution need to do a full manual
bootstrap.  It is recommended to treat this as a cross-compilation
case.
<P>

<DT>31 July 2002</DT>
<DD>A new page has been added to the site, listing <A
HREF="related-projects.html">related projects</A>.  You can find it at
the bottom of the menu.
<P>

<DT>22 June 2002</DT>
<DD>Various developers of the Hurd and people interested in it will meet
at the <A HREF="http://lsm.abul.org/">Libre Software Meeting</A> in
Bordeaux on July 9-13.  Neal Walfield, who is working on porting the
Hurd to the <A HREF="http://www.l4ka.org/">L4</A> microkernel, will give
a presentation about L4, the people from
<A HREF=" http://www.hurdfr.org/">HurdFr</A> will give an
introduction to the Hurd, and another presentation about the Hurd will
be given by Marcus Brinkmann.  There might be additional talks about
the Hurd and related topics.
</P>

<DT>28 May 2002</DT>
<DD>We are pleased to announce version 1.3 of the GNU distribution of
the Mach kernel, featuring advanced boot script support, support for
large disks (>= 10GB) and an improved console.
<P>
This distribution is only for x86 PC machines.
Volunteers interested in ports to other architectures are eagerly sought.
<P>
More <A HREF="gnumach-download.html#release">information about GNU
Mach 1.3</A> is available on the GNU Mach web page.
</P>

<DT>24 May 2002</DT>
<DD>Finally, the transition from the stdio-based GLibC Application
Binary Interface (ABI) to the libio-based GLibC ABI has been
completed.  The Debian GNU/Hurd binary distribution has resumed
building packages again, and everything should be back to normal.
Note that we have also switched to <A
HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.1/">GCC 3.1</A> as our default
compiler.  Thanks to everyone who helped in making all this possible,
and our apologize for any inconvenience we have caused you.
<P>

<DT>18 May 2002</DT>
<DD>The "Linux and Unix User Group Heilbronn" (in Germany) is organizing
a Debian GNU/Hurd <A
HREF="http://www.luug-hn.org/vortraege.html">installation party</A> at
25 May 2002. In addition to that, Wolfgang J&auml;hrling will give a talk
about usage of GNU/Hurd, common problems found in porting programs to
GNU/Hurd and programming of extensions for the Hurd.  It is a public
event, so everyone is free to show up and participate.
<P>

<DT>05 May 2002</DT>
<DD>We are currently finishing the transition from a stdio-based GNU C
Library (glibc) to a libio-based one.  This is the result of about
five months of work we put into getting the system ready and, of
course, the work that the glibc developers did to make glibc what it
is.
<P>
This change will have various advantages, for example libio has been
tested more extensively, as it is also used by most GNU/Linux systems
for some time now.  However, it also means a change in the Application
Binary Interface (ABI) of glibc, thus you will need to reinstall an
existing Debian GNU/Hurd system.  Upgrading has not been tested at
all, so better do not expect it to work.  Also note that you will need
to get some of the Debian packages from <A
HREF="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/hurd/debian-libio/">alpha.gnu.org</A>.
Please read the recent mailing list archives for details.
<P>
<B>Important Note:</B> As another temporary complication, the current
installation tarball is available at <A
HREF="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/hurd/debian-staging/">a different place</A>
than usual.
<P>

<DT>23 March 2002</DT>
<DD>Added <A HREF="/software/hurd/hacking-guide/hhg.html">The Hurd
Hacking Guide</A> to the documentation section.  Thanks to Wolfgang
J&auml;hrling for providing this introduction into GNU/Hurd and Mach
programming!
<P>

<DT>08 March 2002</DT>
<DD>We are pleased to announce version 1.3 of the GNU distribution of the
Mach 3.0 interface generator `MiG'.  It may be found in the file
<SAMP><A HREF="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mig/mig-1.3.tar.gz">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mig/mig-1.3.tar.gz</A></SAMP> (about 145 KB compressed).
<P>
Diffs from version 1.2 are in <SAMP><A HREF="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mig/mig-1.2-1.3.diff.gz">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mig/mig-1.2-1.3.diff.gz</A></SAMP>
(about 6 KB compressed, 15 KB uncompressed).  Relative to version 1.2,
version 1.3 contains only some minor fixes.
<P>
You need this tool to compile the GNU Mach and Hurd distributions, and
to compile GNU libc for the Hurd.
<P>
Bug reports relating to this distribution should be sent to
<A HREF="mailto:bug-hurd@gnu.org">bug-hurd@gnu.org</A>.  Requests for assistance should be made on
<A HREF="mailto:help-hurd@gnu.org">help-hurd@gnu.org</A>.

<DT>03 March 2002</DT>
<DD>There is a new mailing list called <A
HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/hurd-devel-readers">
Hurd-devel-readers</A>. It is the read-only version of Hurd-devel.
<P>
Hurd-devel is a mailing list for detailed discussions
of design and implementation issues in the GNU Hurd; it is an internal
low-volume list restricted to the core developers of the Hurd.  While
the <A HREF="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/hurd-devel/">web-based
archive of Hurd-devel</A> has always been public, the new mailing list
Hurd-devel-readers provides a convenient way to follow
the discussion of the Hurd experts.
<P>
If you are a recipient of Hurd-devel-readers and want
to follow up on the discussion, please reply to the
Bug-hurd mailing list.
<P>
<DT>18 February 2002</DT>
<DD>Pro-Linux has published a <A
HREF="http://www.pl-berichte.de/berichte/hurd/hurd-status/">GNU/Hurd

in the future.
<P>

<DT>19 January 2002</DT>
<DD>The Toronto Hurd User Group meets: The University of Waterloo
Computer Science Club will be hosting a talk on the Hurd and the

gpg keys are not required.
