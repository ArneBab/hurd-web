[[!meta title="IRC"]]

While all official development takes place on the mailing lists and the Savannah trackers, 
a lot of discussions are had on IRC as well. Everybody is welcome to join and follow these channels, but please

[paste bin](http://paste.debian.net).

# Rich Text

Don't use it.  Don't use colors.  Don't use bold.  Don't use emphasis.

# Greeting

If you never contribute to the discussion, there is no need

# Regular Meetings

Starting in early 2008, there have been regular IRC meetings held between the
(now former) [[Google Summer of Code|community/gsoc]] students and their
mentors.  These meetings turned out to considerably help student-mentor
interactions, and other developers regularely took part, too.
<!--
For this reason, we decided to continue having these meetings, even if it's not
currently Google Summer of Code time.
-->
Currently, the meetings take place in the **`#hurd` channel every
Tuesday at 19:00 UTC** and are open to any interested party.  So,
everyone, take your chance to chat with GNU Hurd developers!
