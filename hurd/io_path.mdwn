# read

  * [[glibc]]'s `read` is in `glibc/sysdeps/mach/hurd/read.c:__libc_read`.

  * That calls `glibc/hurd/fd-read.c:_hurd_fd_read()`.

  * That calls `__io_read`, which is an [[RPC]], i.e., that actually results
    into the [[translator/ext2fs]] server calling
    `hurd/libdiskfs/io-read.c:diskfs_S_io_read`.

  * That calls `_diskfs_rdwr_internal`, which calls
    `hurd/libpager/pager-memcpy.c:pager_memcpy`, which usually basically just
    tell the kernel to virtually project the memory object corresponding to the
    file in the caller process's memory.  No read is actually done.

  * Then, when the process actually reads the data, the kernel gets the user
    page fault (`gnumach/i386/i386/trap.c:user_trap`), which calls `vm_fault`,
    etc., until actually getting to `gnumach/vm/vm_fault/vm_fault_page` which
    eventually calls `memory_object_data_request`, which is an [[RPC]], i.e.,
    that actually results into the [[translator/ext2fs]] server calling
    `hurd/libpager/data-request.c:_pager_seqnos_memory_object_data_request`.

  * That calls `hurd/ext2fs/pager.c:pager_read_page`, which looks for where the
    data is on the disk, and eventually calls
    `hurd/libstore/rdwr.c:store_read`, which eventually calls `device_read`,
    which is an [[RPC]], i.e., that actually gets into the kernel calling
    `gnumach/linux/dev/glue/block.c:device_read`.

  * ext2fs eventually finishes the data_request() function, the kernel installs
    the page into the process that got a fault.
