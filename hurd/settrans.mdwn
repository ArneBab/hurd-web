The `settrans` command is used to attach a [[translator]] (server) to a given
[[file_system_node|virtual_file_system]].

`settrans` is commonly used like this:

    $ settrans -fgap *NODE* *TRANSLATOR SETTING*

  * `fg`, **f**orce any existing translator to **g**o away from that node.
  * `ap`, start an ***a**ctive translator*, and also establish a ***p**assive
    translator* setting.

*Active translator* means that the operating system starts the translator
immediately and *passive translator* in turn means that the settings are
instead saved in the file system node, and then, when programs access the node
by, for example, sending an [[RPC]], the Hurd will transparently start the
server to handle the request.


Help on settrans can be obtained by passing it the `--help` option.

Likewise, help on a specific translator can be gotten by invoking it from the
command line with the same argument, e.g.:

    $ /hurd/pfinet --help

As there can be a lot of output, consider piping this through a pager.
