`libstore` is used to provide a generic interface to access data (read/write)
on backing stores.

It more than just a thin layer between [[GNU Mach|microkernel/mach/gnumach]]
devices (`hd0` for example) and the device node below `/dev/`...

    <teythoon> and I read hammys paper about mobile code, is it true that the
      store code is loaded into the client? who is the server and who is the
      client in this context?
    <braunr> teythoon: "store code" ?
    <teythoon> libstore
    <braunr> the hurd libstore ?
    <teythoon> yes
    <braunr> hum, what paper ?
    <teythoon> braunr:
      http://users.student.lth.se/cs07fh9/2009-hammar-hurd-mobility.pdf
    <braunr> how nice
    <tschwinge> braunr: http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2010-01-31.html
    <teythoon> it raises an important point btw, the authentication done by
      processes on the Hurd is one sided, only the client authenticates at the
      server
    <braunr> yes
    <tschwinge> It'S also mentioned in
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/documentation.html -- but of
      course, any results he got from his work really should be integrated more
      properly into the existing body of documents.
    <tschwinge> As with so many other documents/discussions/etc.  ;-|
