`libstore` is more than just a thin layer between
[[GNU_Mach|microkernel/mach/gnumach]] devices (`hd0` for example) and the
device node below `/dev`...

# Available Stores

* `device`: raw device access, used for access to `hd0`, etc.
* `file`: use a common file as some kind of block device.
* `zero`: kind of an empty block device.
* `task`: mach task store backend.  TODO: what's this?
* `ileave`: interleave store (striping).
* `concat`: concatenate stuff.
* `remap`: remap stuff.
* `query`: TODO: what's this?
* `copy`: TODO: what's this good for?
* `gunzip`: `gunzip` data on the fly.
* `bunzip2`: `bunzip2` data on the fly.
* `nbd`: network block device (Linux-compatible).
* `url`: typed store with URL syntax.

At <http://www.kataplop.net/pub/info/projets> you can find some effort to make
some crypto store.
