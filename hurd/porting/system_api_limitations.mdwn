Sometimes building or running a program will fail due to bugs in the system API
implementation (in [[glibc]] and the [[Hurd]]).  Make sure you check this list
and know them before porting, otherwise you'll end up debugging something just
to find out its an already known bug.

Taken from the bug lists in [[running/Debian]] BTS.  If you find more of them
(and it is clear in the bug log that it is a bug), please add them to the list
below.

These are the known system API limits that have porting implications.

**_[\#47998](http://bugs.debian.org/47998): `msgget` IPC not implemented_**

**_[\#184565](http://bugs.debian.org/184565): libc0.3: missing shm\* functions (from `<sys/shm.h>`)_**<br />**breaks:** cdrtools<br />**error:** warning: shm\* is not implemented and will always fail

**_[\#190581](http://bugs.debian.org/190581): nice() doesn't work_**<br />**breaks:** coreutils<br />**error:** `nice()` doesn't take effect on some situations

**_[\#187391](http://bugs.debian.org/187391): libc0.3-dev: `sockaddr_un.sun_path` can't be assigned a `const char *` when compiling with g++_**<br />**breaks:** fam, gail<br />**status:** maybe this should be in [[PortingIssues]] (see _long_ bug log)

**_[\#190367](http://bugs.debian.org/190367): libc0.3-dev: `fcntl` `F_GETLK` not implemented (`ENOSYS`)_**<br />**breaks:** gnome-session (and others) from running<br />**error:** misc lock-related errors
