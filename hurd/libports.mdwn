*libports* is a convenience library for easier handling of [[Mach
ports|microkernel/mach/port]].  It is documented in the [[Reference_Manual]].

*libports* is not (at least, not for now) a generalization / abstraction of
Mach ports to the functionality the Hurd needs, that is, it is not meant to
provide an interface independently of the underlying [[microkernel]].

*libports* does not itself depend on *[[libthreads]]*, but the appropriate
threading hooks are used if present, that is if *[[libthreads]]* is used by
another component.


# Message Processing

## `ports_manage_multithreaded`

When a message is recieved, the thread acting as receiver checks if any other
thread is also waiting for requests.  If there is none, a new thread is
spawned.  Thus, the current thread continues processing the message while the
newly created thread starts listening for new ones.
