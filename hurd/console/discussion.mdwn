# IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2012-09-24

    <allesa> hello, I'm trying to get familiar with the Hurd and would like to
      change the keyboard layout in use. It seems all the information I can
      find (relating to console-driver-xkb) is out of date, with the latest
      info relating to it being that this package should not be used anymore…
    <allesa> does anyone know how changing keyboard layouts currently works?
    <allesa> ah, never mind. I assume it doesn't currently work:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/console.htmlq
    <allesa> *http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/console.html
    <youpi> it does actually work
    <youpi> simply dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
    <youpi> and reboot
    <youpi> (see http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install
    <youpi> )
    <allesa> mhm, I got that far — but selecting my layout gave me no joy, even
      after restart. Seem to be stuck with the layout chosen during
      installation (d-i). Just to check I'm using the right version — still on
      the installer isos from 15 July?
    <allesa> wait… progress is being made — slowly and subtly… 
    <allesa> Ok, so the XKBLAYOUT is changing as you described, but XKBVARIANT
      seems to be ignored. Could this be right?
    <youpi> yes, the hurd console only supports keymaps
    <youpi> (currently)
    <allesa> Ah OK, thanks for your help on this. I imagine this is not
      something that just requires simple repetitive work, but some actual
      hacking?
    <allesa> to fix that is…
    <youpi> some hacking yes

    <pinotree> http://xkbcommon.org/ ¡û sounds interesting for our console
      translator

    <pinotree> teythoon_: df: `/dev/cons': Operation not supported
    <pinotree> missing/stub implementation in the console translator?


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-02

    <teythoon_> pinotree: yes, df does file_statfs which fails

    <C-Keen> hello hurders! I happened to watch samuel's gnu hackers talk and
      wanted to start to use the hurd more regularily. However I noticed that
      when I use the preinstalled image, there seems to be some issue with the
      console driver
    <C-Keen> when I start emacs the mode line is drawn 3 times above the bottom
      of the screen
    <C-Keen> is this know or did I miss a step in setting it up? Or should I
      use the debian installer and start from scratch again?
    <youpi> C-Keen: it's probably unknown, and not an issue on your side. Did
      you try to upgrade to the latest packages?
    <C-Keen> youpi: doing that now
    <C-Keen> my base image is debian-hurd-20130504.img
    <youpi> still an issue with the latest packages indeed
    <youpi> it seems emacs and the hurd console don't agree on the number of
      lines...
    <youpi> C-Keen: you can set TERM=vt100 to work around the issue
    <C-Keen> ah alright.
    <youpi> or TERM=linux
    <C-Keen> youpi: can you start the emacs in X? I get an empty window here
    <youpi> I never tried
    <youpi> I never use emacs :)
    <C-Keen> I see ;)
    <youpi> it seems there's a bug in cud1 indeed
    <C-Keen> what's cud1?
    <youpi> see man 5 terminfo
    <braunr> yes it's a terminfo problem
    <braunr> the hurd console isn't well defined there
    <youpi> braunr: actually it seems like a bug in emacs
    <youpi> cud may or may not scroll the screen, depending on the
      implementation
