# IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2012-09-24

    <allesa> hello, I'm trying to get familiar with the Hurd and would like to
      change the keyboard layout in use. It seems all the information I can
      find (relating to console-driver-xkb) is out of date, with the latest
      info relating to it being that this package should not be used anymore…
    <allesa> does anyone know how changing keyboard layouts currently works?
    <allesa> ah, never mind. I assume it doesn't currently work:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/console.htmlq
    <allesa> *http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/console.html
    <youpi> it does actually work
    <youpi> simply dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
    <youpi> and reboot
    <youpi> (see http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install
    <youpi> )
    <allesa> mhm, I got that far — but selecting my layout gave me no joy, even
      after restart. Seem to be stuck with the layout chosen during
      installation (d-i). Just to check I'm using the right version — still on
      the installer isos from 15 July?
    <allesa> wait… progress is being made — slowly and subtly… 
    <allesa> Ok, so the XKBLAYOUT is changing as you described, but XKBVARIANT
      seems to be ignored. Could this be right?
    <youpi> yes, the hurd console only supports keymaps
    <youpi> (currently)
    <allesa> Ah OK, thanks for your help on this. I imagine this is not
      something that just requires simple repetitive work, but some actual
      hacking?
    <allesa> to fix that is…
    <youpi> some hacking yes
