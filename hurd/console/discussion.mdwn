# IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2012-09-24

    <allesa> hello, I'm trying to get familiar with the Hurd and would like to
      change the keyboard layout in use. It seems all the information I can
      find (relating to console-driver-xkb) is out of date, with the latest
      info relating to it being that this package should not be used anymore…
    <allesa> does anyone know how changing keyboard layouts currently works?
    <allesa> ah, never mind. I assume it doesn't currently work:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/console.htmlq
    <allesa> *http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/console.html
    <youpi> it does actually work
    <youpi> simply dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
    <youpi> and reboot
    <youpi> (see http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install
    <youpi> )
    <allesa> mhm, I got that far — but selecting my layout gave me no joy, even
      after restart. Seem to be stuck with the layout chosen during
      installation (d-i). Just to check I'm using the right version — still on
      the installer isos from 15 July?
    <allesa> wait… progress is being made — slowly and subtly… 
    <allesa> Ok, so the XKBLAYOUT is changing as you described, but XKBVARIANT
      seems to be ignored. Could this be right?
    <youpi> yes, the hurd console only supports keymaps
    <youpi> (currently)
    <allesa> Ah OK, thanks for your help on this. I imagine this is not
      something that just requires simple repetitive work, but some actual
      hacking?
    <allesa> to fix that is…
    <youpi> some hacking yes

    <pinotree> http://xkbcommon.org/ ¡û sounds interesting for our console
      translator

    <pinotree> teythoon_: df: `/dev/cons': Operation not supported
    <pinotree> missing/stub implementation in the console translator?


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-02

    <teythoon_> pinotree: yes, df does file_statfs which fails


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-22

    <C-Keen> hello hurders! I happened to watch samuel's gnu hackers talk and
      wanted to start to use the hurd more regularily. However I noticed that
      when I use the preinstalled image, there seems to be some issue with the
      console driver
    <C-Keen> when I start emacs the mode line is drawn 3 times above the bottom
      of the screen
    <C-Keen> is this know or did I miss a step in setting it up? Or should I
      use the debian installer and start from scratch again?
    <youpi> C-Keen: it's probably unknown, and not an issue on your side. Did
      you try to upgrade to the latest packages?
    <C-Keen> youpi: doing that now
    <C-Keen> my base image is debian-hurd-20130504.img
    <youpi> still an issue with the latest packages indeed
    <youpi> it seems emacs and the hurd console don't agree on the number of
      lines...
    <youpi> C-Keen: you can set TERM=vt100 to work around the issue
    <C-Keen> ah alright.
    <youpi> or TERM=linux
    <C-Keen> youpi: can you start the emacs in X? I get an empty window here
    <youpi> I never tried
    <youpi> I never use emacs :)
    <C-Keen> I see ;)
    <youpi> it seems there's a bug in cud1 indeed
    <C-Keen> what's cud1?
    <youpi> see man 5 terminfo
    <braunr> yes it's a terminfo problem
    <braunr> the hurd console isn't well defined there
    <youpi> braunr: actually it seems like a bug in emacs
    <youpi> cud may or may not scroll the screen, depending on the
      implementation


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-28

    <braunr> ahem, looks like the last xkb-data package dropped
      /usr/share/X11/xkb/compat/default :/
    <ivanshmakov> braunr: Looks more like an upstream issue; check, e. g.,
      http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/commit/?id=882f5470713d.
    <ivanshmakov> braunr: Slightly more surprising is that xkb-data 2.8 was
      packaged for Debian last Sunday. While the upstream has released 2.10.1
      back in October, as per
      http://www.x.org/releases/individual/data/xkeyboard-config/.
    <gg0> ivanshmakov:
      http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xkeyboard-config/news/20131222T160519Z.html
    <ivanshmakov> gg0: ACK, thanks. (No idea how did I read 2.10.1 as 2.8, as I
      was looking on essentially the same information.)


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-30

    <ZenWalker> on debian/hurd, with startx, show the error "cannot open
      keyboard (no such file or directory)"
    <braunr> ZenWalker: what version of xkb-data do you have ?
    <ZenWalker> braunr: 2.10.1-1
    <braunr> ZenWalker: there is a bug in that package
    <braunr> you can confirm it by spotting an error during system startup that
      mentions a missing "compat/default" file
    <braunr> this prevents the hurd console from starting
    <braunr> and without the hurd console, xorg can't find the input device
    <braunr> hopefully it will be fixed soon
    <ZenWalker> braunr: yes, "couldn't open include file "compat/default""
    <ZenWalker> thanks


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-31

    <braunr> youpi1: fyi, xkb-data doesn't provide compat/default, which
      prevents the hurd console from starting

    <ZenWalker> braunr: X works with xkb-data 2.5.1-3 :)

    <braunr> maybe xkb-data isn't the problem
    <braunr> maybe we need to fix the hurd-console
    <braunr> youpi: we should probably fix the hurd with regard to xkb-data
      before releasing the next packages
    <braunr> it's very unlikely that xkb-data will be fixed
    <braunr> they say compat/default is unused since march 2012


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-01-01

    <DusXMT> Is anyone else having problems with the console?
    <gg0> downgrade xkb-data to
      http://snapshot.debian.org/package/xkeyboard-config/2.5.1-3/#xkb-data_2.5.1-3
    <DusXMT> ty


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-01-04

    <mihi> does anybody know if the fact that aptitude looks shitty on the hurd
      console is a bug in the console implementation or some broken
      term{cap,info} config?
    <youpi> ncurses is pending a terminfo fix, possibly related
    <youpi> you can try to recompile your hurd terminfo entry, adding xenl to
      it, and see whether it fixes it
    <mihi> hmm, just did an aptitude upgrade, and now after a restart the Hurd
      console does not even start any more (did not mess with my terminfo yet)
    <mihi> Couldn't open include file "compat/default"
    <youpi> yes, xkb-data broke, downgrade it
    <mihi> youpi, to which version?
    <youpi> well, the previous one :)
    <mihi> (or can aptitude or another tool show me what version I had
      previously?)
    <youpi> you can simply take the but-last on snapshot.debian.org
    <mihi> youpi, thanks, that helped. And adding xenl to hurd.ti and
      recompiling helped, too :)


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-01-13

    <gnu_srs> Couldn't open include file "compat/default" from the console
    <teythoon> that has been reported on the ml and as debian bug
    <teythoon> a workaround is both in the upcoming hurd package as well as in
      the ones i provide in hurd-ci
    <gnu_srs> Any workaround for the hang in the console for now?
    <teythoon> there is no hang
    <teythoon> there is simply no getty
    <gnu_srs> how come?

    <gnu_srs> and the xkb-data problems I thought was causing problems with the
      hurd console to start, not the mach console.
    <teythoon> gnu_srs: exactly, the missing xkb data prevents your
      hurd-console from running


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-02-05

    <bu^> btw, does the console handle other keymaps than the qwerty US one ?
      Samuel thibault talked about this during his fosdem conference
    <braunr> it does
    <braunr> check /etc/default/hurd-console
    <bu^> how ? I mean which lib does it use, because I face a similar issue
      with my programms and would like a "smart" way to handle this (meaning
      not reimplement something doing it worse)
    <bu^> thx
    <braunr> bu^: xkb
    <bu^> I'm not clear with xkb and how much it is related to xorg, I would
      like to be xorg independant, but the hurd console also should be and it
      seems to work
    <youpi> bu^: xkb is just a library
    <youpi> xorg uses it
    <youpi> but other applications can use it
    <youpi> it just happens to be maintained by x.org people
    <bu^> oh ok, nice, I'll look at it
    <bu^> we are talking about this one ?
      http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/XKB/xkblib.html
    <youpi> yes
    <bu^> btw the way special caracters like é or à breaks the backspace
      (erase) key as it will not count properly the number of caracters on the
      line
    <bu^> and I end up with remaining caracters I can't erase
    <bu^> I also started to look for this one but didn't find a proper way to
      use it as a library http://www.kbd-project.org
    <youpi> bu^: probably a bogus locale
    <youpi> that just works for me

    <gg0> to reproduce "task f5ca6e40 deallocating an invalid port 1711, most
      probably a bug." just restart hurd-console
