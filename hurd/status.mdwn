The last official release of the Hurd was 0.2.  An 
eminent release is not planned.  There are a number of
reasons for this. 

One is that the Hurd is not sufficently stable or feature
complete.  If an official release of the Hurd were made
now, people would try the Hurd and be disappointed.  People
already expect delays; to disappoint them in this way as
well would be unfortunate. Moreover, it lessens the
possibility that they will try the Hurd again in the future.

Another reason is that, Debian provides a [[distribution|running/debian]] that
closely tracks Hurd development (and often includes many
new features).  Little is to be gained by making an official
release.
