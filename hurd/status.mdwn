The Hurd team doesn't create hurd-only releases, but instead relies 
on a distribution done by folks from **Debian**. 

That Debian version closely tracks the progress of the Hurd 
(and often includes many new features), 
so little would be gained by creating an official pure Hurd release. 

The Debian GNU/Hurd [[distribution|running/debian]] offers **livecds and qemu images** 
to test-drive the Hurd in a real life system with access to about 
50% of the Debian software archive. 

The most recent version of the Debian port at the time of writing 
is Debian GNU/Hurd K16. 


That said, the last official release of the Hurd 
without the Debian parts was 0.2 done in 1997. 

New official releases will be done, as soon as 
the Hurd is sufficently stable and feature
complete.  If an official release of the Hurd were made
now, people would try the Hurd and be disappointed.  People
already expect delays; to disappoint them in this way as
well would be unfortunate. Moreover, it would lessen the
possibility that they would want to try the Hurd again in the future.
