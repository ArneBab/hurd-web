    <braunr> work around this by using showtrans
    <braunr> fsysopts asks the server itself how it's running, usually giving
      its command name and options
    <braunr> showtrans asks the parent how it starts a passive translator
      attached to the node
    <gnu_srs> Yes showtrans works :), thanks.
