A sub-Hurd is like a [[neighbor_Hurd|neighborhurd]], however, makes use of some
resources provided by another Hurd.  For instance, backing store and the
console.

Sub-hurds are extremely useful for debugging core servers as it is possible to
attach to them with gdb from the parent
([[debugging_via_subhurds|debugging/subhurd]]).  This avoids deadlock, e.g.,
when the instance of gdb stops the server but requires its use.  (Note: it is
possible to use [[debugging/gdb/noninvasive_debugging]], but this is less
flexible.)


# Howto

## Preparing

To run a subhurd, you need an additional partition with an installed Hurd
system.  In principle, you can also use your main partition in read-only mode;
but this obviously will create severe limitations.  Usually, you will want a
complete independant system.

The system for the subhurd is a normal Hurd installation, which could just as
well run standalone.  You can use any of the various possible installation
methods, or reuse an existing installation if you already have several.  If
using [[Debian_GNU/Hurd|running/debian]], the easiest is probably to use
[[running/debian/crosshurd]], which you can run directly from your main Hurd to
set up another Hurd on a different partition, without ever rebooting.  (You can
run the `native-install` step from a chroot or already in a subhurd.)


## Booting

To boot the subhurd, you need a boot script.  For historical reasons, usually
`/boot/servers.boot` is used. (Originally, this was also used to boot the main
Hurd, using "serverboot".  Nowadays, this isn't used for the main boot anymore,
as GRUB can directly load all the necessary modules.)

However, the canonical `/boot/servers.boot` file is no longer distributed with
[[Debian_GNU/Hurd|running/debian]].  Here is a slightly adopted version:

       # Boot script file for booting GNU Hurd.  Each line specifies a file to be
       # loaded by the boot loader (the first word), and actions to be done with it.

       # First, the bootstrap filesystem.  It needs several ports as arguments,
       # as well as the user flags from the boot loader.
       /hurd/ext2fs.static --bootflags=${boot-args} --host-priv-port=${host-port} --device-master-port=${device-port} --exec-server-task=${exec-task} -Tdevice ${root-device} $(task-create) $(task-resume)

       # Now the exec server; to load the dynamically-linked exec server program,
       # we have the boot loader in fact load and run ld.so, which in turn
       # loads and runs /hurd/exec.  This task is created, and its task port saved
       # in ${exec-task} to be passed to the fs above, but it is left suspended;
       # the fs will resume the exec task once it is ready.
       /lib/ld.so.1 /hurd/exec $(exec-task=task-create)

       ## default pager
       #/dev/sd0b $(add-paging-file)

/!\ It's very important not to introduce spurious line breaks, so be very
careful when copying!  All the options following `ext2fs.static` have to be on
a single line.

Now actually booting the subhurd is a simple matter of issuing (as root):

       boot servers.boot /dev/hd0s6

(Replace `hd0s6` by the name of your partition for the subhurd.)

/!\ The partition must be unmounted (or mounted read-only) before you boot from
it!

(In theory it shouldn't be neccessary to run the subhurd as user `root`, but in
practice [that doesn't work at the
moment](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?17341).)

Now the subhurd should boot just like a normal Hurd started directly from GRUB,
finally presenting a login prompt.  The `boot` program serves as proxy for the
subhurd, so you can control it from the terminal where you issued the boot
command.

To exit the subhurd, issue `halt` or `reboot`.  This should exit it cleanly,
but for some reason it doesn't always work; sometimes it will output various
errors and then hang.  If that happens, you need to kill the subhurd processes
manually from a different terminal.


## Using

In the subhurd, you can do basically all the same things as in the main Hurd.

You can even set up networking: Just invoke `settrans` on the
`/servers/socket/2` as usual inside the subhurd, only using a different local
IP than in the main Hurd.  This way, the subhurd will be able to communicate to
the outside world with its own IP -- allowing for example to do `apt-get`
inside the subhurd, or to `ssh` directly into the subhurd.

If you want to access the subhurd processes from the outside, e.g. for
[[debugging_purposes|debugging/subhurd]] (or to get rid of a subhurd that
didn't exit cleanly...), you need to find out how main Hurd PIDs correspond to
subhurd processes: the subhurd processes appear in the main Hurd (e.g. if doing
`ps -e`) as unknown processes, and vice versa, but the PIDs are different!  To
find out which process is which, you can simply compare the order -- while the
numbers are different, the order should usually match.  Often it also helps to
look at the number of threads (e.g. using `ps -l`), as many servers have very
characteristic thread counts.
