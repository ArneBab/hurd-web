[[!template id=note text="""**GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU
FSDG)**

The [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) can't recommend Debian
GNU/Hurd or the Arch distribution; we must suppose that they don't meet our
freedom standards any more than Debian GNU/Linux and the Arch distribution
based on the Linux kernel do.  Likewise we have not evaluated other GNU/Hurd
distributions in regard to ethical criteria.  Please visit
<http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html> to learn
what those standards are."""]]

Working distributions of GNU/Hurd: 

* [[Debian]]

GNU/Hurd distributions in early stages of development: 

* [[Arch|arch_hurd]] (features a LiveCD)
* [[Nix]]

Defunct GNU/Hurd distributions:

  * Bee GNU/Hurd.  Castellano distribution, pkgsrc package based.
  * [[GNU]]
  * Unofficial port to Gentoo and the portage system.  It was
    [announced](http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=41939&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0)
    March 17, 2003 in the Gentoo forums, but development stopped at some point.

        <WhiteKIBA> we are trying to revive Gentoo/hurd
        <WhiteKIBA> we are using debian as a start
        <WhiteKIBA> we installed portage on debian and are now bootstrapping
          the system into a folder
        <WhiteKIBA> except glibc everything seems fine

          want to know more.

        <WhiteKIBA> natsukao: http://wiki.rout0r.org/index.php/Gentoo/Hurd/en I
          am working on it
        <WhiteKIBA> if i can get glibc to compile correctly i can create a
          stage3 but at the moment it fails
