> *Did you work a bit more on the Gentoo GNU/Hurd?*

I tried to resume my work 3-4 months ago but I found some problems with
portage and python functions not implemented on Hurd so I stopped. I think
that back in 2006 with portage 2.0.54 those functiones weren't necessary.

I just have all the ebuilds and binary packages I merged online on
[http://www.mundurat.net/ggh/portage](http://www.mundurat.net/ggh/portage). 

To continue my work just take a Debian/Hurd and install portage by hand.

Once there take the profile and start bootstraping portage and all the
ebuild it needs (patch, python, bzip2...).

The major problems are:

- combine the perfect gcc/binutils/glibc/gnumach/hurd and to be able to boot
- lack of development on gnumach/hurd and current 'degraded' status.

I don't think I can help much right now, but if you have any other
question just write me.
