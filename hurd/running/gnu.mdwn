The GNU Operating System, or GNU System as it is more commonly known, will be a
complete [[Unix]]-like operating system composed entirely of [free
software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).  The creation of the GNU
System is one of the goals of the [GNU Project](http://www.gnu.org/), which was
[launched in 1983](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html) by
[Richard Stallman](http://www.stallman.org/).
