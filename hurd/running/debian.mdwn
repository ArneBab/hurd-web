# `/etc/mtab` -> `/proc/mounts`

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-02-12

    <braunr> hm, there is something weird
    <braunr> after successfully installing (with the new installer cd), and
      rebooting, system init fails because fsck can't be run on /home (a
      separate partition)
    <braunr> it can't fsck because at that point, /home is already mounted, and
      indeed the translator is running
    <braunr> teythoon: any idea what might cause that ?
    <teythoon> me ?
    <teythoon> no
    <braunr> ok
    <braunr> ah no, actually /home isn't mounted oO
    <braunr> but fsck still refuses to check it, stating that reason
    <braunr> hm, /etc/mtab isn't a link to /proc/mounts here, might explain


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-02-12

    <braunr> yes, better with a proper symlink :)
    <teythoon> good
    <youpi> Mmm, what is supposed to create that symlink?
    <teythoon> one debian init script did that at one time
    <teythoon> i believe they dropped that
    <youpi> err, but something must be creating it for newer systems
    <teythoon> good point
    <braunr> well, except for these small details, everything went pretty
      smooth
    <braunr> both on ide and ahci
    <youpi> it seems /etc/mtab gets created at boot
    <youpi> (on Linux I mean)
    <teythoon> youpi: i cannot find the init script, but i'm sure that it was
      there
    <youpi> I can't find it either on the installed system...
    <azeem> maybe pere or rleigh in #debian-hurd can help

    <braunr>   6<--60(pid1698)->dir_lookup ("var/run/mtab" 4194305 0) = 0 3
      "/run/mtab"  (null)
    <braunr> looks like /etc/mtab isn't actually used anymore
    <teythoon> it never was on hurd
    <tomodach1> braunr: well it is generated i believe from mounted filesystems
    <tomodach1> if its still around there is a reason for it, like posix
      compatiblity perhaps?
    <braunr> well the problem is that, as mentioned in pere's thread on
      bug-hurd, some tools now expect /var/run/mtab instead of /etc/mtab
    <braunr> and since nothing currently creates this file, these tools, such
      as df, are lost
    <braunr> they can't find the info they're looking for


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-02-17

    <braunr> i still don't have mtab at the proper location on darnassus
    <pere> is there something missing with sysvinit on hurd?
    <braunr> is that normal ?
    <pere> yes.  I recommended fixing it in the hurd package. (BTS #737759)
    <braunr> yes i saw but was there any action taken ?
    <pere> did not check
    <teythoon> i thought youpi mentioned that it is fixed in the libc and we
      just need to rebuild coreutils or something
    <pere> yes
    <braunr> oh ok
    <braunr> but doesn't that mean it will use /etc/mtab ?
    <pere> if I was a hurd porter, I would fix it in hurd while waiting for a
      fix in coreutils, just to save people for wondering about the breakage,
      but I am not the most patient of developers. :)
