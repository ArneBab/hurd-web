The GNU stands for GNU's Not [[Unix]].  It is a project as described in [[GNU]].

What can be confusing is the usage. GNU can stand for:

* an entire system as envisioned in 1983. GNU/Hurd is a synonym.
* GNU components when used with the Linux kernel: GNU/Linux This term has been adopted by the [Debian project](http://www.debian.org) but is not recognized as widely as the FSF would like.
