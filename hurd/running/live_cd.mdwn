You can download a gzipped iso of a Hurd Live CD at:

The Superunpriveleged crew also offers a tiny Hurd Live CD that is under 10 megabytes:

* [A disk image with an installation of the Debian distribution of GNU/Hurd](http://www.numenor.art.pl/balrog/hurd/)


These [LiveCDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCD) should be useful for those who want to try out the Hurd before they commit to installing it on their hard disks. In addition to that, the bootable Hurd CDs should enable us to have a native installer instead of relying on Linux.
