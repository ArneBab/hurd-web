[[Arch Hurd|hurd/running/arch_hurd/]] offers Hurd LiveCDs at <http://www.archhurd.org/download/>.

A less recent Live CD can be found at <http://teythoon.cryptobitch.de/hurd/livecd/hurd-live-install-1273300101.iso.xz>. 

It can be run with qemu via 

    $ wget http://teythoon.cryptobitch.de/hurd/livecd/hurd-live-install-1273300101.iso.xz
    $ xz -d hurd-live-install-1273300101.iso.xz
    $ qemu -m 512 -cdrom hurd-live-install-1273300101.iso

These [[!wikipedia LiveCD]]s should be useful for those who want to try out the
Hurd before they commit to installing it on their hard disks.  In addition to
that, the bootable Hurd CDs should enable us to have a native installer instead
of relying on Linux.
