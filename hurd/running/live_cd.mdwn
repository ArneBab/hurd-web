You can download a gzipped iso of a Hurd Live CD at
<http://www.superunprivileged.org/hurd/live-cd/>.

The Superunpriveleged crew also offers a tiny Hurd Live CD that is under 10
MiB: <http://www.superunprivileged.org/hurd/tiny-cd/>

Use it like this:

    $ qemu -cdrom hurd-tiny-cd-20060722.iso

These [[!wikipedia LiveCD]]s should be useful for those who want to try out the
Hurd before they commit to installing it on their hard disks.  In addition to
that, the bootable Hurd CDs should enable us to have a native installer instead
of relying on Linux.
