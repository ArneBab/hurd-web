This QEMU image is not (yet) comparable to NixOS, because the latter provides
extra features, such as whole-system configuration (including services, etc.),
and whole-system transactional update and rollback.  It is is cross-built using
Nix, and because of that, it uses per-package installation directories under
`/nix/store`.


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-02-04

    <braunr> is it possible to use nix ?
    <braunr> or nixos
    <civodul> you mean the Nix-based Hurd image?
    <braunr> yes
    <civodul> it's currently broken:
      http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/hurd-master
    <braunr> aw, nixos uses systemd :(
    <civodul> yeah, but the Hurd image is a different thing
    <civodul> is uses runsystem.sh™
    <civodul> (my favorite)
    <civodul> i've been willing to unbreak it, but now i rather invest time in
      Guix
