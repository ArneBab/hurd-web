I find that this is all quite quick to try and that I can run through the
./native-install and reboot cycle twice OK.  However, at that point the
installed Hurd boots up but fails to display a login prompt.  This is the case
for both K10 and K14 using VMware Workstation 5.0.0 under Windows XP.  Maybe
I'm doing something wrong but it is hard to see what.  I'd be interested to
know more precisely what other people find does work.
