There is a QEMU image with [[Debian GNU/Hurd|debian]] pre-installed available

Usage:

    $ wget http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.gz

    <mcsim> scp doesn't work either
    <braunr> what ?
    <braunr> why wouldn't it ?
    <mcsim> scp -P5555 -r ./hurd/ root@localhost:/root/src/
    <mcsim> root@localhost's password: 
    <mcsim> The Hurd is not Linux. Make sure to read
    <braunr> that shouldn't happen ...
    <braunr> use tar maybe ?
    <mcsim> the same with tar archive

    <teythoon> braunr: mcsims scp problem is b/c youpis images echo stuff from
      the .bashrc or something
    <teythoon> i wish he'd change that, as it is a reoccuring problem
    <teythoon> youpi: ^
    <teythoon> (didn't realize you are around >,<)
    <teythoon> now that /etc/issue is displayed, you can put the welcome text
      there
    <braunr> teythoon: i see
    <teythoon> mcsim: your ssh trouble are rooted in the .bashrc printing some
      stuff to stdout
    <mcsim> teythoon: thank you. It works now
    <teythoon> :)
