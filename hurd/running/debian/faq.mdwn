# Reporting Bugs

Please try to reproduce bugs which are not obviously Hurd-specific on Debian
GNU/Linux and then file them there.

If you find a genuine issue in Debian GNU/Hurd, please file it in our Alioth
bug tracker at
[http://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?atid=411594&amp;group\_id=30628&amp;func=browse](http://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?atid=411594&group_id=30628&func=browse)
If you find a bug in the Hurd or GNU Mach themselves, either file a bug against
the respective Debian packages, or directly at
<http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=hurd>


# `ps` Hangs

If `ps` hangs, try `ps -M` which might still work.


# Porting Packages


# Debugging inside glibc

To get [[debugging]] information for glibc, you need to install the
`libc0.3-dbg` package.  At the place [[debugging/GDB]] looks for debugging
symbols by default (`/usr/lib/debug/lib/`), Debian's `libc0.3-dbg` stores only
frame unwind information.  If you want to step into glibc while debugging, you
need to add `LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/usr/lib/debug` to GDB's environment.  If that
still does not work, try `LD\_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/debug/libc.so.0.3` instead.  You
can add to GDB's environment via `set env FOO bar` from the GDB command line.

It seems that this is no longer needed with the Debian glibc 2.5 packages, but
I may as well be wrong.  Have to check that again.


# Debugging Translators

In order to [[debug|debugging]] translators and being able to step into glibc
during it, you need the `hurd-dbg` and `libc0.3-dbg` packages installed.  Then
start the translator like `settrans -P /foo /usr/bin/env
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/usr/lib/debug /hurd/foofs`. The `-P` option will make it
pause and you will be able to attach [[debugging/GDB]] to the process.

Is starting the translator like this really needed?


# Other Repositories

If you want to use the `apt-get source` facility, make sure that
`/etc/apt/sources.list` contains a line like

    deb-src http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian unstable main

... replacing _de_ with your homeland's code.
