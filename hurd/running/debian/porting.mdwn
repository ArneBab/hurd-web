[[!meta title="Debian packages that need porting"]]

Approximately half of the Debian archive has been compiled successfully on the
Hurd, however, many programs fail to build for various reasons.

A [list of build failures including error
messages](http://unstable.buildd.net/buildd/hurd-i386_Failed.html) can be
found, as well as a [preliminary
analysis](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2007/07/msg00000.html) of them and [solutions](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2007/07/msg00001.html).

It might be a good idea to record your intention to port something either in
the list below or in the [Alioth task
tracker](http://alioth.debian.org/pm/task.php?group_project_id=34&group_id=30628&func=browse)
so other people do not do duplicated work.

Aside from the Alioth task tracker, here is a list of some packages (the
important ones, as they're, e.g., blocking other packages from being built)
that need someone to work on them.

When you have a patch to submit, please adhere to the [[patch_submission]]
guidelines.

There is also further information available about [[hurd/porting]].
