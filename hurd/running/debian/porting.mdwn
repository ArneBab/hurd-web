[[meta title="Debian packages that need porting"]]

A large amount of Debian source packages can (by now) simple be built for
Debian GNU/Hurd systems.

Here are listed some of those (the important ones, as they're, e.g., blocking
other packages from being built) that need someone to work on them.

When you have a patch to submit, please adhere to the [[patch_submission]]
guidelines.
