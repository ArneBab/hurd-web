There is no `/etc/mtab` (due to dynamic translator startup, its content is hard
to define actually, see
[[the mtab GSoC project idea|community/gsoc/project_ideas/mtab]]),
so just running `df` will yield the following error.

    df: cannot read table of mounted file systems

Pass `df` a path like `df /` or `df ./` to see the disk usage of that particular
file system.
