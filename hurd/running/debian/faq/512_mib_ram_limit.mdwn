[[meta title="512 MiB RAM Limit"]]

GNU Mach does not cope well with lots of memory.  Newer versions of the Debian
`gnumach` package will limit themselves to around 1 GiB of memory.  If you have
an older version, or still experience problems with `vmstat` (see above)
reported much less memory than you have, the best is to limit the memory it can
see via GRUB's `upppermem` feature.  Add `uppermem 786432` to GRUB's Hurd entry
in `menu.lst`.
