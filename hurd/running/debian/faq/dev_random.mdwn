[[!meta title="/dev/random"]]

There is no random device by default as no secure implementation has been
finished yet.  An easy (but very insecure) work-around is to copy a binary file
like `/bin/bash` to `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom`.  A slightly more secure
alternative is installing the `random-egd` from the `debian-ports` repository.
