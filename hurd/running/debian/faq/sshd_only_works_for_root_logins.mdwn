This isssue has been fixed in the Debian hurd / libc0.3 packages as of 2010-11.
Retire this item sometime after 2011.

Privilege seperation does not work with Hurd currently.  You need to explicitely 
set `PrivilegeSeparation` to `no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_options`, just commenting out 
the entry will not work as it is on by default.  Also make sure you have 
`/dev/random`, see below.
