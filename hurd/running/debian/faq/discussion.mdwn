Someone should check and incorporate the following:

> You can add a shell script umount so that apt can automatically unmount
> cdroms
> 
>     #!/bin/sh
>     # Filename: /usr/bin/umount
>     
>     settrans -fg "$@"
> 
> Give executable permission to the script
> 
>     # chmod +x /usr/bin/umount
> 
> In /etc/fstab add a trailing '/' after cdrom like /cdrom/ since apt uses a traing '/'
