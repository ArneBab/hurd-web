First steps after installation.

So you have managed to get past the first `native-install` runs in single-user
mode?

Time to get to work.

### Get Networking Running

[[Network]].

Check if your NIC was detected by GNU Mach:

    # devprobe eth0

`devprobe` (run as user *root*) will print `eth0` on successful detection.  If
it doesn't, your NIC was not detected correctly.  You can then try to do the
following (also as user *root*) for getting details:

    # cat /dev/klog > ~/klog
    [Wait a second, then press `Ctrl-C'.]

Now examine the `~/klog` file.

If the NIC was detected:

    # settrans -fgap /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet -i eth0 -a 192.168.1.3 -g 192.168.1.1 -m 255.255.255.0

Or read about how to configure [[DHCP]].


# Setup GRUB

You surely want grub to have a nice menu entry able to boot GNU, instead of
typing a boring arcane.  There are Debian-specific scripts that may help
you.  See [[GRUB]]'s page for this.


# Setup `apt-get`

Sometimes getting `apt-get` to work is not straightforward.  Good mirrors to
put in `/etc/apt/sources.list` are:

    deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
    deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
    deb http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian unreleased main
    deb-src http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian unreleased main

`apt-get` update a couple of times if some file fails to download.

If when doing your first `apt-get`, `dpkg` complains of missing programs, get root in a login shell (`su -`).

Installing packages without having a network connection is described
[[Distrib/DebianAptOffline]].

# [[translator/Random]]

You often need `scp` and `ssh`.  There is now a `random-egd` package available which uses
a random translator by Ryan Hunter and the entropy gathering daemon as entropy source.

See [[Translator/random]] for more information.

# [[Console]]

The latest Hurd package in Debian, plus the `native-install` script, creates
all necessary device nodes and other magic.  You just need to edit
`/etc/default/hurd-console` to tune the parameters and tell it to start at
bootup.

You can also call the Hurd console manually with the proper arguments:

    console -d vga -d pc_kbd --repeat=kbd -d pc_mouse --repeat=mouse \
            -d generic_speaker -c /dev/vcs


# [[Hurd/DebianXorg]]

You first must have setup the virtual console.  See above.

# What about package XYZ?
