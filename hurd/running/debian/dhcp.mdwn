In order to use DHCP, you need to install the `ifupdown` and `isc-dhcp-client`
packages, and manually create the following symbolic link:

    # ln -s ../rcS.d/S10networking /etc/rc.boot/

During execution at boot time, the `S10networking` script will emit some error
messages while trying to configure the loopback interface.  These are not
fatal.

Debian GNU/Hurd doesn't currently execute Debian standard `/etc/rcS.d/*` boot
scripts, but has its own `/libexec/rc` script -- which integrates scripts from
`/etc/rc.boot/` instead.
