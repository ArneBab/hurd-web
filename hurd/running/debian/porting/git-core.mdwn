Depends on [[libdbd-sqlite3-perl]].

Does build, but has test-suite problems (only where libdbd-sqlite3-perl is
involved, it seems):

    [...]

    [...]

Stopping the test-stuite (`C-c`), doing a `touch build-arch-stamp`, followed by
re-running `dpkg-buildpackage` with `-nc` will yield an installable `deb`
package.
