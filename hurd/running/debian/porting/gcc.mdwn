For GCC trunk:

Debian package has patches (for 4.3).  Some have been forwarded upstream.  (And
have been ignored.)  [[Thomas_Schwinge|tschwinge]] is working on getting them
integrated.

  * [\[meta-bug\] bootstrap bugs for
    \*-gnu\*](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21824)

  * [build system: gcc\_cv\_libc\_provides\_ssp and
    NATIVE\_SYSTEM\_HEADER\_DIR](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2008-10/msg00130.html)

      * [-fstack-protector shouldn't use TLS in freestanding
        mode](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29838)

  * [Port libgcc's configury for
    \*-\*-gnu\*](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2008-10/msg00315.html)


Additionally:

  * `libgcc/configure.ac` [might
    need](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2008-10/msg00315.html) to be
    aligned for us to the `*linux*` cases.  As well as at the end of
    `libgcc/config.host`.  Check.

        checking whether decimal floating point is supported... no
        checking whether fixed-point is supported... no

  * Also in other places: configure fragments that have `*linux*` cases
    might/should often contain those for us (and GNU/k*BSD) as well.
