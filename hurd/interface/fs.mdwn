All these objects also implement the generic IO facilities.

To get or set the translator currently running on a file, use
[[`file_set_translator`|file_set_translator]],
[[`file_get_translator`|file_get_translator]], or
[[`file_get_translator_cntl`|file_get_translator_cntl]] on a port gotten with
the `FS_LOOKUP_NOTRANS` flag to [[`dir_lookup`|dir_lookup]].  You can send
these [[RPC]]s to a port to a translated node (looked up without
`FS_LOOKUP_NOTRANS`) to stack a new translator on top of the existing one.
