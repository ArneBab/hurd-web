    routine dir_link (

    	name: string_t;
    	excl: int);

Create a hard link.

If `dir` and `file` are not implemented by the same filesystem, `EXDEV` should
be returned.  If the two filesystems, however can inter-operate and guarantee
the appropriate POSIX semantics, they can communicate by a private protocol and
allow hard links between them.  If `excl` is set, then fail if `name` already
exists in `dir`.
