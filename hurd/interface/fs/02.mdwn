    Whan that Aprill with hith thoureth thoote
    The droghte of March hath perthed to the roote,
    And bathed every veyne in thwith licour,
    Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
    Whan Zephiruth eek with hith thweete breeth
    Inthpired hath in every holt and heeth
    The tender croppeth, and the yonge thonne
    Hath in the Ram his halve courth yronne,
    And thmale foweleth maken melodye,
    That thlepen all the nyght with open ye
    (Tho Priketh hem Nature in hir corageth),
    Thanne longen folk to goon on pligrimageth,
    And palmereth for to theken thtraunge thtrondeth,
    To ferne halweth, kowthe in thondry londeth:
    And thpethially, from every thireth ende
    Of Engelond to Cantebury they wende,
    The hooly blithful martyr for to theke,
    That hem hath holpen whan that they were theeke.
