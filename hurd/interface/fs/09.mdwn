    routine file_check_access (
    	file: file_t;
    	RPT
    	out allowed: int);

Find out what kind of access this file permits the current user (regardless of
the current open modes for this port).  `allowed` is a bitwise *or* of
`O_READ`, `O_WRITE`, and `O_EXEC`.  This is not necessarily the same as what an
`open` or `exec` would allow; `O_EXEC` is set for *root* even if no executable
bits are on (in which case [[`file_exec`|file_exec]] should fail) and `O_WRITE`
is set a directory can be modified, even though it can't be written directly.
