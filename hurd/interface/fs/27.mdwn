Set a translator for future lookups to a file.

`passive` is the passive translator; `active` is the active translator.

The `flags` are `FS_TRANS_*`, defined in `<hurd/hurd_types.h>`.  `oldflags` are
sent in an [[`fsys_goaway`|fsys_goaway]] to an existing active translator if
there is one and it is to be killed.
