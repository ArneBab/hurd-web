    routine dir_mkfile (

    	out newnode: mach_port_send_t);

Create a new file without linking it into the filesystem.  You still must have
write permission on the specified directory, even though it will not actually
be written.  Return in `newnode` a port to the file.  `flags` are the same as
for [[`dir_lookup`|dir_lookup]], but `O_CREAT` and `O_TRUNC` are assumed even
if not specified.
