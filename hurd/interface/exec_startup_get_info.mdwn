This call is made by a new task to its bootstrap port to get its startup ports
and information.

Implemented regularely by the [[hurd/translator/exec]] server
(`exec/exec.c`:`S_exec_startup_get_info`), and also [[hurd/translator]]s based
on [[hurd/libdiskfs]]
(`libdiskfs/boot-start.c`:`diskfs_S_exec_startup_get_info`) because these *look
like an execserver to the execserver itself; it makes this call (as does any
task) to get its state*.

Used solely in [[glibc's process startup|glibc/process]]
(`hurd/hurdstartup.c`:`_hurd_startup`).
