    routine fsys_forward (
    	server: mach_port_t;
    	RPT
    	requestor: mach_port_send_t;
    	argv: data_t);

Ask `server` to provide [[`fsys`|fsys]] translation service for us.
`requestor` is the bootstrap port supplied to the original translator, and
`argv` are the command line arguments.  If the recipient accepts the request,
he (or some delegate) should send [[`fsys_startup`|fsys_startup]] to
`requestor` to start the filesystem up.
