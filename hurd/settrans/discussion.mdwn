# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-06-01

    <antrik> ugh... I just realized why settrans -a without -f doesn't
      generally work on filesystem translators
    <antrik> obviously, it needs -R too!


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-08-17

    <antrik> youpi: no, only the -g is redundant; i.e. -ga is the same as -a
    <antrik> (actually, not redundant, but rather simply meaningless in this
      case)
    <antrik> -g tells what to do with an active translator *when a passive one
      is changed*
    <antrik> if no passive one is changed, it does nothing
    <antrik> (and I realized that after using the Hurd for only 6 years or so
      ;-) )
    <braunr> it's not obvious
    <antrik> braunr: indeed. it's not obvious at all from the --help output :-(
    <antrik> not sure though how to make it clearer
    <braunr> the idea isn't obvious
    <braunr> perhaps telling that "setting a passive translator" also applies
      to removing it, i.e. setting it to none
    <antrik> braunr: well, the fact that a translator is unset by setting it to
      nothing is unclear in general, not only for passive translator. I agree
      that pointing this out should make things much more clear in general...


# <a name="chroot">`--chroot`</a>

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-08-29

    <teythoon> btw, I somehow feel settrans is being abused for chroot and
      friends, there is no translator setting involved
    <youpi> chroot, the command? or the settrans option?
    <youpi> I don't understand what you are pointing at
    <teythoon> the settrans option being used by fakeroot, remap and (most
      likely) our chroot
    <youpi> our chroot is just a file_reparent call
    <youpi> fakeroot and remap do start a translator

[[virtualization/remap_root_translator]], [[virtualization/fakeroot]].

    <teythoon> yes, but it is not being bound to a node, which is (how I
      understand it) what settrans does
    <teythoon> the point being that if settrans is being invoked with --chroot,
      it does something completely different (see the big if (chroot) {...}
      blocks)
    <teythoon> to a point that it might be better of in a separate command
    <youpi> Mmm, indeed, a lot of the options don't make sense for chroot
