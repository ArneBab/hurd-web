Certain [[translator]]s do not need to be very complex, because they represent
a single file rather than an entire directory hierarchy.  The *trivfs library*,
which is declared in `<hurd/trivfs.h>`, does most of the work of implementing
this kind of translator.  This library requires the [[iohelp|libiohelp]] and
[[ports|libports]] libraries.

Using `libtrivfs` is not the only way to implement such a single-file
translator, but is a convenient abstraction: the library hides a lot of
low-level stuff and you just have to provide a number of call-back functions
and symbols in order to get a functioning (for file I/O, etc.) node in the file
system.
