In traditional monolithic system, the kernel keeps track of all mounts; the
information is available through `/proc/mounts` (on Linux at least), and in a
very similar form in `/etc/mtab`.

The Hurd on the other hand has a totally
[[decentralized_file_system|hurd/virtual_file_system]].  There is no single
entity involved in all mounts.  Rather, only the parent file system to which a
mountpoint ([[hurd/translator]]) is attached is involved.  As a result, there
is no central place keeping track of mounts.

The `mtab` translator has been implemented; see the [[discussion]] subpage for
design considerations.
