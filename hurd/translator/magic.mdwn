The magic translator provides `/dev/fd`.

    $ showtrans /dev/fd
    /hurd/magic --directory fd

The `/dev/fd` directory holds the open file descriptors for your current
process.  You can't see them with `ls -l /dev/fd/` but you can see them
individually like this:

    $ ls -l /dev/fd/0
    crw--w----  1 bing tty 0, 0 Nov 19 18:00 /dev/fd/0
