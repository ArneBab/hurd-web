`mboxfs` is a translator meant to help people sorting emails.
It parses mailboxes in order to create a directory hierarchy representing
the contents of the mailbox.
Thus, you can sort emails per recipient, senders, date, and much more.
It supports attachments (put in a separate *attach* directory).
