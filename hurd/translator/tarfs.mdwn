`tarfs` is a translator aimed at providing access to tar files through the
filesystem.  This way you don't have to extract files from the archive to
access them.  It supports compressed archives (bzip2 and gzip) through
[[libstore]].


# Status

Works fine on most cases, occasional corruptions when writing using bzip2/gzip
stores.
