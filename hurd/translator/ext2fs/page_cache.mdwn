This is not at all specific to ext2fs, so should be integrated elsewhere.

    <Tekk_> is there any particular reason ext2fs takes so much memory?
    <Tekk_> it beats everything on my system hands down at 100 MB
    <youpi> ext2fs contains the page cache
    <youpi> so it's no wonder it takes memory
    <youpi> it's all the mapped files
    <Tekk_> any way I can cut down on that?
    <Tekk_> my system only has 512 meg :/
    <youpi> gnumach is supposed to automatically cut it down as needed
    <youpi> what is the actual symptom that you see?
    <Tekk_> youpi: 360 MB of memory usage when I'm doing nothing
    <Tekk_> oh, is it just intelligent enough to cut down when I'm using more
      memory?
    <youpi> Tekk_: yes
    <Tekk_> awesome. I was worried :)
