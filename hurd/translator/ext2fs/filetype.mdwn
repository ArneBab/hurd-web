The *ext2fs* translator doesn't support the ext2 format's *filetype* option.

According to *mke2fs(8)*:

> **filetype**: Store file type information in directory entries.

By setting directory listings' informational `d_type` field (`readdir`, etc.),
this may avoid the need for subsequent `stat` calls.

Not all file systems can support this option.

In `[hurd]/ext2fs/dir.c` the `EXT2_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_FILETYPE` is generally
masked out (is not even considered) when adding a node to a directory in
`diskfs_direnter_hard` and when reading in `diskfs_get_directs`.  The Hurd's
ext2fs unconditionally sets this field to 0 (`EXT2_FT_UNKNOWN`).


# `e2fsck`

Running `e2fsck` on a file system with the *filetype* option, will correct the
*filetype* for a lot of files (all `EXT2_FT_UNKNOWN`?) to either 1 (regular
file, `EXT2_FT_REG_FILE`), or 2 (directory, `EXT2_FT_DIR`), and likely others.
The Hurd's ext2fs will again ignore these fields, of course.
