    <youpi> this was supposed to be much better than our current netio
    <youpi> (which doesn't really have any documentation btw)

    <teythoon> youpi: socketio looks nice. any reason in particular why you are
      working on it?
    <youpi> teythoon: I was looking at the firewall stuff, and wondering about
      Zheng Da's work, and seen netio, thus wondered "what is it about
      already?" and found there was no documentation, so dug into the mailing
      list archives, only to find it was supposed to be precated in favour of
      socketio, etc. :)
