    <youpi> ok, so as usual we actually *already* have a firewall
    <youpi> it's the eth-filter translator from zheng da
    <youpi> it has just never been really pushed forward...
    <teythoon> good news :)
    <youpi> well, the bad news is that it probably doesn't support connection
      tracking
    <youpi> since it's just bpf
    <youpi> using the libpcap syntax
    <teythoon> well, a stateless fw should do for Debian/Hurds needs for now,
      right?
    <youpi> yes
    <youpi> and it does work indeed
