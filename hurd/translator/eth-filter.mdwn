`eth-filter` is a translator that implements a very simple stateless firewal.

# Source

[[source_repositories/incubator]], dde

# Usage:

For instance, to drop any attempt to access port 22:

    settrans -c /dev/eth0f /hurd/eth-filter -i /dev/eth0 -r "not port 22"

This creates a /dev/eth0f device, which is the filtered version of /dev/eth0. One can then configure network by hand using /dev/eth0f instead of /dev/eth0:

    settrans /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet -i /dev/eth0f ...

or run dhclient /dev/eth0f, etc.
