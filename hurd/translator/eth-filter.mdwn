`eth-filter` is a translator that implements a very simple stateless firewall.


# Source

[[source_repositories/incubator]], dde


# Usage

For instance, to drop any attempt to access port 22:

    # settrans -c /dev/eth0f /hurd/eth-filter -i /dev/eth0 -r "not port 22"

This creates a `/dev/eth0f` device, which is the filtered version of
`/dev/eth0`.  One can then use `/dev/eth0f` instead of `/dev/eth0`:

    # settrans /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet -i /dev/eth0f [...]

..., or run `dhclient /dev/eth0f`, or similar.

    <youpi> ok, so as usual we actually *already* have a firewall
    <youpi> it's the eth-filter translator from zheng da
    <youpi> it has just never been really pushed forward...
    <teythoon> good news :)
    <youpi> well, the bad news is that it probably doesn't support connection
      tracking
    <youpi> since it's just bpf
    <youpi> using the libpcap syntax
    <teythoon> well, a stateless fw should do for Debian/Hurds needs for now,
      right?
    <youpi> yes
    <youpi> and it does work indeed
