To configure Internet connectivity, the `pfinet` (*Protocol Family Internet*)
[[translator]] must be configured.  This is done using the
[[`settrans`|settrans]] command, for example like this:

    # settrans -fgap /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet ↩
        -i eth0 -a 192.168.0.50 -g 192.168.0.1 -m 255.255.255.0

The argument `/server/socket/2` is the node that the translator is to be
attached to.  This is followed by the translator program to run and any
arguments to give it.

There, `-i`, `-a`, `-g` and `-m` are, quite obviously, the (Mach) device to
use, the IP address, the gateway and netmask.

To make DNS lookups work, you'll also have to properly configure the
`/etc/resolv.conf` file, for example by copying it over from your GNU/Linux
installation.
