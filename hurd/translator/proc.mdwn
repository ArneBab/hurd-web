    <braunr> too bad the proc server has pid 0
    <braunr> top & co won't show it

    <pinotree> youpi: did you see
      https://enc.com.au/2012/09/careful-with-pids/'
    <pinotree> ?
    <youpi> nope

    <teythoon> I've got this idea about the pid 1 issue you mentioned
    <teythoon> can't we just make init pid 1?
    <teythoon> I mean the mapping is rather arbitrary, we could make our init
      pid 2 or something and start sysvs init as pid 1
    <pinotree> not totally sure it is that arbitrary up to the first 4-5 pids
    <teythoon> y is that?
    <pinotree> at least i see in hurd's code that /hurd/init is assumed as
      pid=1
    <teythoon> hurds init that has to stick around for the fs translator sync?
    <pinotree> hurd's init does the basic server startup
    <pinotree> iirc it also takes care of shutdown/reboot
    <teythoon> that's what I meant
    <teythoon> and if it wouldn't have to stick around for the translator sync
      it could just exec sysvinit
    <teythoon> I just think it's easier to patch hurd than to remove the
      assumption that init is pid 1 from sysvinit
