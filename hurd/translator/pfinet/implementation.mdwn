    <braunr> youpi: there are indeed historical bugs with small packets and
      tcp_nodelay in linux 2.0/2.2 tcp/ip
    <youpi> oh

    <youpi> I was thinking about just using liblwip this afternoon, btw
    <braunr> what is it ?
    <braunr> hm, why not
    <braunr> i would still prefer using code from netbsd
    <braunr> especially now with the rump kernel project making it even easier
    <youpi> well, whatever is easy to maintain up to date actually
    <braunr> netbsd's focus on general portability normally makes it easy to
      maintain
    <braunr> the author of the rump project was able to make netbsd code run in
      browsers :)
    <braunr> and he actually showed clients using the networking stack on
      windows, remotely (not in the same process)
    <braunr> so that's very close to what we want
    <youpi> indeed
    <youpi> though liblwip is exactly the same portability focus :)
    <braunr> apparently, for embedded systems
    <youpi> but bsd's code is probably better
    <youpi> yes
    <braunr> i think so, more general purpose, larger user base
    <youpi> I used it for the stubdomains in Xen
    <youpi> (it = lwip)
    <braunr> ok
