[[Stefan_Siegl|stesie]] has added IPv6 support to the pfinet [[translator]].
This was [Savannah task #5470](http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?5470).


# Implementation

Because the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are
quite related to each other (think of mapped IPv4 addresses, etc.), there is no
separate [[server|translator]] for IPv6 but support for the latter has been
incorporated into the common pfinet.  Unfortunately it's a little bit clumsy
now to set the [[translator]] up, since it has to be bound to
*/servers/socket/2* (like before) as well as */servers/socket/26* (for IPv6).

To achieve this, you can tell pfinet to install [[active_translators|active]]
on specified nodes, using **-4** and **-6** options.  This is, you have to
install a [[passive_translator|passive]] on */servers/socket/2* that also binds
the IPv6 port and vice versa.


# Examples

Normal IPv4 network setup, address 192.168.7.23/24 and gateway 192.168.7.1.
IPv6 address shall be assigned using IPv6 auto-configuration.

    settrans -fgp /servers/socket/2 ↩
      /hurd/pfinet -6 /servers/socket/26 ↩
      -i eth0 -a 192.168.7.23 -m 255.255.255.0 -g 192.168.7.1
    settrans -fgp /servers/socket/26 ↩
      /hurd/pfinet -4 /servers/socket/2 ↩
      -i eth0 -a 192.168.7.23 -m 255.255.255.0 -g 192.168.7.1

Quite the same, but with static IPv6 address assignment:

    settrans -fgp /servers/socket/2 ↩
      /hurd/pfinet -6 /servers/socket/26 ↩
      -i eth0 -a 192.168.7.23 -m 255.255.255.0 -g 192.168.7.1 ↩
      -A 2001:4b88:10e4:0:216:3eff:feff:4223/64 -G 2001:4b88:10e4::1
    settrans -fgp /servers/socket/26 ↩
      /hurd/pfinet -4 /servers/socket/2 ↩
      -i eth0 -a 192.168.7.23 -m 255.255.255.0 -g 192.168.7.1 ↩
      -A 2001:4b88:10e4:0:216:3eff:feff:4223/64 -G 2001:4b88:10e4::1


# Binaries

For your convenience -- this work is not yet available in the Debian packages
-- binaries of a patched (multicast reception) GNU Mach kernel (including
default driver set and debugging support) and a stripped pfinet translator
(named `pfinet6` here) are being provided at
<http://brokenpipe.de/GnuHurd/pfinet6/>
