    < frhodes> how can I replace an existing running server with a new one
      without rebooting?
    < antrik> frhodes: depends. if other critical things depend on it, you
      can't. there is no mechanism to serialize and pass on the open sessions
    < antrik> in some situations, you can orphan the old translator while
      starting a new one, so the previous clients will stay with the old one
      while new one will get the new one
    < antrik> obviously that only works for things that aren't exclusive by
      nature
    < antrik> in some cases, you might even be able simply to remove the old
      translator... but obviously only for non-critical stuff :-)
