    <gg0> seems fifos started dying, as they should. am i wrong?
    <gg0> ( http://bugs.debian.org/629184 )
    <azeem> so you're saying the bug should be closed?
    <azeem> best to comment on the bug then
    <gg0> i didn't hear anyone working on it, so i'm a bit surprised
    <azeem> could be due to lower-level fixes to glibc or so
    <gg0> and given often(:|) i'm wrong, i was asking
    <pinotree> in two years there have been various changes in glibc and hurd
    <pinotree> (for example the switch to pthreads)
    <gg0> yeah seems fixed. mknod'ing one then removing it, doesn't leave any
      process around
    <gg0> cool
    <azeem> then please follow-up on the bug and/or close it
    <gg0> sure
    <gg0> the pleasure of closing it/them is yours
    <gg0> great job, whatever you did :)
