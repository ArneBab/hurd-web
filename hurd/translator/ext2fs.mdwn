# Implementation

  * [[filetype]] option

  * [[Hurd-specific_extensions]]

  * [[Page_cache]]


## Large Stores

The `ext2fs` translator from the upstream Hurd code base can only handle file
systems with sizes of less than roughly 2 GiB.

### Ognyan's Work

  * Ognyan Kulev, [[*Supporting Large ext2 File Systems in the
    Hurd*|ogi-fosdem2005.mgp]], 2005, at FOSDEM

  * Ognyan Kulev, [[large_stores]]

  * <http://kerneltrap.org/node/4429>

Ognyan's patch lifts this limitation (and is being used in the
[[Debian_GNU/Hurd_distribution|running/debian]]), but it introduces another
incompatibility: `ext2fs` then only supports block sizes of 4096 bytes.
Smaller block sizes are commonly automatically selected by `mke2fs` when using
small backend stores, like floppy devices.
