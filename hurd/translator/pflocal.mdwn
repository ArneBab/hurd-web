## `SO_REUSEADDR`

### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-19

    <gnu_srs> Hi, is SO_REUSEADDR supported at all on Hurd? I can only find two
      entries: 
    <gnu_srs> in libdde-linux26 and pfinet/linux-src, and the functionality
      seems to be unimplemented.
    <pinotree> gnu_srs: pfinet supports it
    <youpi> gnu_srs: grep talks about  pfinet/linux-src/net/core/sock.c:
      case SO_REUSEADDR:
    <youpi> two times
    <gnu_srs> Yes, and that is the implementation?
    <gnu_srs> I wrote a test for AF_INET and it works, but not for AF_UNIX
      (maybe not so interesting case).
    <pinotree> pflocal does not support it
    <gnu_srs> Is that of interest at all?
