## `SO_REUSEADDR`

### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-19

    <gnu_srs> Hi, is SO_REUSEADDR supported at all on Hurd? I can only find two
      entries: 
    <gnu_srs> in libdde-linux26 and pfinet/linux-src, and the functionality
      seems to be unimplemented.
    <pinotree> gnu_srs: pfinet supports it
    <youpi> gnu_srs: grep talks about  pfinet/linux-src/net/core/sock.c:
      case SO_REUSEADDR:
    <youpi> two times
    <gnu_srs> Yes, and that is the implementation?
    <gnu_srs> I wrote a test for AF_INET and it works, but not for AF_UNIX
      (maybe not so interesting case).
    <pinotree> pflocal does not support it
    <gnu_srs> Is that of interest at all?

    <braunr> sudo -s eats 100 cpu :/
    <braunr> possibly because of pflocal
    <braunr> only change on pflocal (notwithstanding the libraries) is
      "pflocal: improve the demuxer functions"
    <braunr> teythoon: why did you change the order of the function calls in
      sock_demuxer ?
    <youpi> for efficiency iirc
    <braunr> yes, looks reasonable


### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-01-16

    <braunr> i suspect the "improve the demuxer functions" changes may have
      hard-to-understand side effects 
    <teythoon> yes, mostly being faster
    <braunr> ah, the latest sudo has been fixed
    <braunr> haha :)
    <teythoon> ^^
    <braunr> that one is easy to understand :)
    <braunr> sudo was looping around calls to pflocal
    <braunr> and exim crashed because of pfinet
    <braunr> and those servers were only affected by these changes, other than
      the library ones which don't seem to apply at all
    <braunr> but with sudo being fixed, i'm not sure it's relevant any more
    <teythoon> i'd say being faster could easily cause hard-to-understand side
      effects
    <braunr> ah, yes
    <braunr> being faster isn't the side effect itself ;p
    <braunr> nice, sudo was bugged on linux too, its behaviour matched its hurd
      version perfectly


## [[hurd/fsysopts]]

Doesn't support [[hurd/fsysopts]].
