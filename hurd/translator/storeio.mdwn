`storeio` is a *translator for devices and other stores*.

It relies heavily on [[libstore]].


# Examples

You can make a file's content available as some block device (where `foo` is
the name of the file to map):

    settrans -ca node /hurd/storeio -T file foo

You can even `ungzip` files on the fly (`bunzip2` is available as well):

    settrans -ca node /hurd/storeio -T gunzip foo.gz

You can use the *typed store*, to create filter chains (of course this example
is kind of useless since you could use the `gunzip` store directly):

    settrans -ca node /hurd/storeio -T type gunzip:file:foo.gz
