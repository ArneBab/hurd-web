It is possible to run multiple instances of the Hurd
in parallel, on a single instance of Mach.  Other than
performance [[crosstalk]], they are essentially isolated.
Practically, as many devices do not allow multiple
non-[[cooperating|cooperation]] users, e.g., hard drive and network
this is not currently possible.  It can be overcome,

When extra hardware is not available, it is possible to use a
[[sub-Hurd|subhurd]].


# Etymology

*Neighborhurd* is a pun on *neighborhood*, and a stance against hierarchies.
