Some bits about this, some bits about that.

# Controlling TTY

Hurd controlling tty behavior is generally consistent with BSD's, including
`TIOCSCTTY`.  Linux also has `TIOCSCTTY` and it is harmless to use it there.
But BSD and Hurd never do an implicit `TIOCSCTTY` (hence our `O_NOCTTY` is
zero).

following messages.

# Sinals

[[Unix]] signals are implemented in glibc.

In every process, signals are handled in a separate signal thread.

    [Why does kill hang sometimes?]
    <youpi> kill send the signal to the process
    <youpi> if the process is hung, killing waits
    <youpi> signals should be just asynchronous, but apparently for some reason
      Roland & co wanted some syunchronization
