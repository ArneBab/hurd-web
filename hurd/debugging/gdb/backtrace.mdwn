When someone asks you to supply a backtrace (from a [[segmentation_fault]], for
example), here is roughly what you have to do.

Run the faulting program like this:

    $ gdb --args PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]
    [...]
    (gdb) run
    [...]
    [Segmentation fault.]
    (gdb) bt
    [...]

(!) This will only provide useful information if the executable (and additional
libraries) contain debugging symbols, or those are available separartely.

If you're one a [[Debian_GNU/Hurd_system|running/distrib/debian]], you'll have
to have the *hurd-dbg* package installed for debugging Hurd stuff, and perhaps
*libc0.3-dbg* as well if it's inside the glibc.
