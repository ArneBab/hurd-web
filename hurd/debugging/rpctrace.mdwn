*rpctrace* is -- roughly -- an equivavlent to Linux's *strace* or Solaris' or
BSD's *truss*.  It is used to trace [[remote_procedure_call|rpc]]s a process is
doing.

See `rpctrace --help` about how to use it.

        <youpi> how to rpctrace a translator ?
        <youpi> ah, just settrans /usr/bin/rpctrace...
        <youpi> hum, it hung, and killing it got a Mach panic (thread in unexpected
          state) ...

        <antrik> hm... for a funny effect, try running rpctrace on
          /servers/socket/1, and then use dpkg... ;-)

        <youpi> the problem of rpctrace is that it's a man in the middle :)
        <youpi> so in principle, by design authentication stuff shouldn't work
        <antrik> I don't think the Hurd auth mechanism in any way prevents or tries to prevent man-in-the-middle...
        <youpi> maybe, but just try, you'll see all kinds of issue as soon as you have authentication stuff
        <youpi> and the basic reason is that being a man in the middle needs special care
        <youpi> which rpctrace doesn't completely do
        <antrik> it's a while since I have dived into rpctrace; but AIUI, it should work just fine if the proxying is done properly
        <antrik> note that there is a number of known bugs in rpctrace, for which zhengda has sent patches... though I haven't reviewed all of them I think
        <antrik> there are some nasty Mach operations that are really hard to proxy -- but I don't think the auth mechanism needs any of these...
