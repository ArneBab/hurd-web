The [GNU debugger *GDB*](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) works on GNU/Hurd
systems as it does on other system, but has some additional [hurd-specific
features](http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_19.html#Hurd%20Native)
to offer, such as [[noninvasive_debugging]] (for avoiding [[deadlock]]s), for
example.
