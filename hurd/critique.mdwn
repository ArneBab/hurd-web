[[meta title="A Critique of the GNU Hurd Multi-server Operating System"]]

Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann wrote a paper titled [*A Critique of
the GNU Hurd Multi-server Operating
System*](http://walfield.org/papers/200707-walfield-critique-of-the-GNU-Hurd.pdf).
This was published in ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review in July 2007.  This
is sometimes referred to as *the critique*.

The paper provides a technical overview of the Hurd's
architecture and critiques some of the decisions made.
