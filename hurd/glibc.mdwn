# Cross-building

The long-term goal is to get `build-many-glibcs.py` to be able to cross-compile
glibc. This should be working as per the following:

    $ mkdir -p /tmp/build/src
    $ cp -a /usr/src/glibc /tmp/build/src/
    $ unset CFLAGS
    $ /tmp/build/src/glibc/scripts/build-many-glibcs.py /tmp/build checkout binutils-2.29 gcc-7.1.0
    $ /tmp/build/src/glibc/scripts/build-many-glibcs.py /tmp/build host-libraries
    $ /tmp/build/src/glibc/scripts/build-many-glibcs.py /tmp/build compilers i686-gnu
    $ /tmp/build/src/glibc/scripts/build-many-glibcs.py /tmp/build glibcs i686-gnu

Currently the master branch builds that way, it only has a few testsuite failures:

    # We do use nested functions which require trampolines in ld.so, libc.so, and libpthread.so
    ./elf/check-execstack.test-result:FAIL: elf/check-execstack
