    <Steap> what's the difference between PSTAT_STATE_P_STOP and
      PSTAT_STATE_T_HALT in libps/ps.h ?
    <youpi> Steap: from reading the gnumach source, it seems halted threads are
      thread which have finished they work but not finished terminating yet
    <youpi> while STOP is the standard preempted state
    <youpi> i.e. not sleeping, but have handed cpu to another thread
    <Steap> youpi: thanks. Is this "halted" state similar to anything in Linux
      ?
    <youpi> TASK_DEAD, probably
