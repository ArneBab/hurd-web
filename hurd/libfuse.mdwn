`libfuse` is an Hurd-specific implementation of [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net),
initially written by Stefan Siegl.

The implementation takes advantage of the [[translators|translator]] facilities
of Hurd: this means that applications that implement a FUSE filesystem, when
compiled against libfuse-hurd, become translators to be set with usual `settrans`
etc.


# Status

* Only part of the API is implemented
    * lowlevel API not implemented
    * Options handling not implemented
    * CUSE lowlevel not supported (compatibility level 29)
* Supports the compatibility level 25 (while current libfuse 2.9.x provides 26)
