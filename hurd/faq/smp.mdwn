[[!meta title="Does GNU/Hurd support SMP/Multicore?"]]

The Hurd servers themselves are multithreaded, so they should be able to take benefit of the parallelism brought by SMP/Multicore boxes. This has however never been tested yet because of the following.

Mach used to be running on SMP boxes like the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_iPSC/860 | iPSC 860]], so has an infrastructure for running on them. It has however not (yet) been ported to nowadays' SMP standards like ACPI etc.

That is why for now GNU/Hurd will only uses one logical processor (i.e. one core or one thread, depending on the socket type).
