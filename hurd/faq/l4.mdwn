[[meta title="Why is there no information on the official website about the
Hurd port to L4 (Hurd/L4)?"]]

There is an ongoing effort to port the Hurd to the L4 microkernel family.  This
will take time and the port is not in a releasable state -- this is why there
is no information about the L4 port on the website for the Hurd project
<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd> other than this FAQ entry.

The development of Hurd/L4 is being done in the `hurd-l4` module of the Hurd
CVS repository.  The `doc` directory contains a design document that is worth
reading for anyone who wishes to learn more about Hurd/L4.  If you wish to
follow the development or contribute patches to Hurd/L4, please subscribe to
the [[mailing_lists/l4-hurd]] mailing list.
