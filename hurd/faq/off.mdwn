[[!meta title="How am I supposed to shut my Hurd system down?"]]

The GNU/Hurd does not use SYSV runlevels, so commands like

    $ shutdown -h now

will not work. Simply use the equivalent shortcut

    $ halt

which is provided natively on GNU/Hurd, instead of from SYSV runlevels.

## Unmounting bug

Sometimes the root file system is not unmounted cleanly
even when the `halt` command is used to shutdown the system.
Therefore we recommend you use the following command:

    $ sync

and wait a few seconds before issuing the `halt` command.
An `fsck` may still be triggered on the next boot,
and you may encounter the [[open_issues/e2fsck_i_file_acl_hi]] bug,
but these errors are harmless.
