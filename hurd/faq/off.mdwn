[[!meta title="How am I supposed to shut my Hurd system down?"]]

The GNU/Hurd does not use SYSV runlevels, so commands like

    $ shutdown -h now

will not work. Simply use the equivalent shortcut

    $ halt

which is provided natively on GNU/Hurd, instead of from SYSV runlevels.

Note that due to a bug,
we [[recommend you run syncfs|open_issues/sync_but_still_unclean_filesystem]]
prior to issuing the `halt` command.
