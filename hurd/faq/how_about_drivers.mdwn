[[!meta title="What drivers does GNU/Hurd have?"]]

Currently, Mach integrates drivers from Linux 2.0 through some glue code. As
it's very old, that limits hardware support a lot, of course. We are however
working on using the DDE toolkit to run linux drivers in userland processes,
which provides both long-term support for new hardware and safety against driver
bugs.
