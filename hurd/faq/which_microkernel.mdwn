[[!meta title="What happened to the L4/Coyotos/viengoos micro-kernels?"]]

L4 was promising but happened to not be suitable for implementing a general-purpose operating system on top if it. See [[history/port_to_l4]].

Coyotos is abandoned upstream

Neal Walfield started working on a newly designed kernel called [[microkernel/viengoos|viengoos]]. Unfortunately, he currently lacks time and the projects it paused.

In the meanwhile, people are thus continuing with [[microkernel/mach]].
