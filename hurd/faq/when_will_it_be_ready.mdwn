When it is ready :)

It is worth noting that it <b>is<b> already ready for use for some
cases. Olaf actually uses it everyday already since years. Two thirds
of the Debian packages are built (not necessarily tested, though). Some
things are however not implemented yet and probably need to be, see
[[community/weblogs/ArneBab/what_we_need]].
