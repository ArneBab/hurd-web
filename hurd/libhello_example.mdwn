## Howto write a Hurd library

Build the Hurd sources:
------------------------

Refer to this [[hurd/building/example]].

Create the library files:
----------------------

Create a directory, say, libhello in the Hurd sources directory. 

Create a lhello.h header file:

    /* lhello.h - Example library header file.

    #ifndef _HURD_HELLO_H
    #define _HURD_HELLO_H	1
    
    struct hello
    {
      int x;
    };
    
    #endif	/* _HURD_HELLO_H */

Replace filename, year, author name and e-mail address appropriately.

Create a lhello.c file:

    /* lhello.c - Example library .c file.

    #include "lhello.h"
    
    void 
    print_hello (void)
    {
      struct hello example;
      example.x = 2;
      printf ("foo and bar are %d words!\n", example.x);
    } 

Replace header file year, author name and e-mail address appropriately.

Create a Makefile

    dir := libhello
    makemode := library
    
    libname := libhello
    SRCS = lhello.c
    installhdrs = lhello.h
    LCLHDRS = $(installhdrs)
    
    OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)
    
    include ../Makeconf

Update the Makeconf file:

Add libhello to lib-subdirs target in the top-level Makefile in the Hurd
sources.

    cd build
    ../configure
    make

Testing the library
-------------------

Write a file, say, foo.c:

    /* foo.c */
    
    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    
    int
    main (int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      print_hello();
      return 0;
    }

Static compilation and linking method:

    gcc -g -o foo foo.c -L/path/to/libhello -lhello -static

Run the example:

    ./foo

Compilation and dynamic linking method:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/libhello
    gcc -g -o foo foo.c -L/path/to/libhello -lhello

where /path/to/libhello = /path/to/hurd/build/libhello

Run the example:

    ./foo
