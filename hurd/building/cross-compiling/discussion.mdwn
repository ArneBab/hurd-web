What happens if the external link goes down? Is there any way to store files
within the wiki itself? --[[vincentvikram]]

> You can store files in the wiki if you have direct access to the Git
> repository.

> I'm not sure I'd like arbitrary people to be able to store files in the wiki,
> as that might be abused easily and once a file is stored in the Git
> repository, there's no clean way to get rid of it anymore.  Of course, there
> are valid cases for adding raw files, then you can always send me a link and
> ask me to add that file.

> Now, as for the `cross-gnu` shell script, as I said: it will eventually be
> made part of the Hurd CVS repository.
