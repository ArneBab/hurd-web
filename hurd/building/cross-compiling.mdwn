[[Thomas_Schwinge|tschwinge]] has written a shell script for building a
complete cross-build environment for GNU/Hurd systems.

For now, find the shell scripts at
<http://nic-nac-project.de/~schwinge/tmp/cross-gnu> and
<http://nic-nac-project.de/~schwinge/tmp/cross-gnu-env>.

Read through it.  Understand it.  Then use it.
