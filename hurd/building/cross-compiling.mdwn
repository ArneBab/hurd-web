# `cross-gnu`

[[Thomas_Schwinge|tschwinge]] has written a shell script for building a
complete cross-build environment for GNU/Hurd systems.

For now, find the shell scripts at
<http://nic-nac-project.de/~schwinge/tmp/cross-gnu> and
<http://nic-nac-project.de/~schwinge/tmp/cross-gnu-env>.

Read through it.  Understand it.  Then use it.

/!\ Be made aware that -- while it is of course possible to build a working
cross-compiler -- this is not trivial to do.  You'll have to patch several of
the source packages.  See the corresponding Debian unstable source packages
about which Hurd-specific patches exist and check which of them are not yet in
the upstream source packages.  Not all of the patches from the Debian packages
are needed for getting a functional tool chain, though.  Applying patches is
definitely needed for the glibc, Hurd and GCC source packages, as there are a
bunch of outstanding patches that are needed for getting a functional build.
