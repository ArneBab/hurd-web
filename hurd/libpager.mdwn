    <braunr> mcsim: is it correct that a pager (as from libpager) object is
      created per file ?
    <mcsim> braunr: hello. Yes.
    <mcsim> braunr: At least this applies to ext2fs

### Writeback: Writing Out Dirty Pages

#### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-03-04

    <braunr> and btw, here is a little update about my roadmap: while reading
      mcsim's patches, i've got to know libpager a bit more, and i think it's
      perfectly possible to add writeback throttling without a heavy rework
    <youpi> good :)
    <braunr> so i intend to work on that after the pager related patches (large
      store and neal's one) are merged
