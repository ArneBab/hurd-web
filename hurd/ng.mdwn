Hurd-ng is an effort to build a new operating system that preserves
the main design goals of the Hurd while fixing some of the Hurd's
shortcomings.  There is not yet an official roadmap or a concrete
specification; indeed, much of the work is research oriented.

These pages try to summarize the major discussions and ideas.


# Why ngHurd

This section explains the motivations behind the new design:

  * Issues with Mach:
    [[microkernel/mach/gnumach/open_issues/resource_management_problems]]
  * [[Issues_with_L4_Pistachio]]
  * [[Limitations_of_the_original_Hurd_design]]

  * History of the [[history/port_to_L4]]


# Work already done

A [[position_paper]] by Marcus Brinkmann and Neal H. Walfield can be found.

A draft specification of the Hurd-NG interfaces has been, but is no longer,
available.

A [[critique]] of the original Hurd is available.

## Organization

Summaries should obey the following structure:

* if there is a consensus, it is clearly described
* if controversial points remain, there are also described after the consenus
* if no choice has been clearly made, all valid positions are descrbied
* withdrawed and invalid positions (prooved wrong, unrealistic, contradictory
  to some design principle, etc.) should be described only very briefly, and
  developed in a separate article

Each time a point seems to be overly long with respect to the rest of the
article, it should be summarized in place and developed in a separate article.
