[[meta title="Porting the Hurd to L4: Hurd/L4"]]

There was an effort to port the Hurd from [[microkernel/Mach]] to the
[[L4_microkernel_family|microkernel/L4]], mostly lead by Marcus Brinkmann and
Neal Walfield.  Even though there was progress, this port never reached a
releasable state.  Eventually, a straight-forward port of the original Hurd's
design wasn't deemed feasible anymore by the developers.  Read the [[critique]]
and a [[ng/position_paper]].

By now, the development of Hurd/L4 has stopped.  However, Neal Walfield moved
on to working on a newly designed kernel called [[microkernel/viengoos]].


Development was done in the `hurd-l4` module of the Hurd CVS repository.  The
`doc` directory contains a design document that is worth reading for anyone who
wishes to learn more about Hurd/L4.  Discussion have been held on the
[[mailing_lists/l4-hurd]] mailing list, which is still the right place for
[[next-generation_Hurd|ng]] discussions.
