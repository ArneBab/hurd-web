# On Posting

Before asking a question on a list, first make an effort to find the answer
to your question.  When you ask your question, (1) be details, and (2) demonstrate
that you have made an effort, e.g., "I am having trouble frobbing the foo.  I
searched the web and only found information regarding how to frob a bar, but
that seems unrelated."

List etiquette is to cc the sender and anyone **actively** involved in the
discussion. Some people don't like this and they set their reply-to header
appropriately.  Respect this.

It is rarely appropriate to cc multiple lists.  Sometimes it is.  In that case,
do so.  If in doubt, don't; just choose the single most appropriate list.

When replying to others, please don't top-post and trim the existing text to
quote only the sections you're actually replying to.  See [[wikipedia
Posting_style]] for further reading, especially [[wikipedia
Posting_style#Inline_replying]].

# Main Lists

The lists are [[unmoderated]] and most of them are hosted on
<http://lists.gnu.org/>.  Try to post to the appropriate mailing list.

Some of the Hurd user groups listed on [[community]] also host additional
mailing lists.
