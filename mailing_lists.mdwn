# On Posting

[[!inline pages=asking_questions raw=yes feeds=no]]

List etiquette is to cc the sender and anyone **actively** involved in the
discussion. Some people don't like this and they set their reply-to header
appropriately.  Respect this.

It is rarely appropriate to cc multiple lists.  Sometimes it is.  In that case,
do so.  If in doubt, don't; just choose the single most appropriate list.

When replying to others, please don't top-post and trim the existing text to
quote only the sections you're actually replying to.  See [[!wikipedia
Posting_style]] for further reading, especially [[!wikipedia
Posting_style#Inline_replying]].

Also see these general notes about [[community/communication]].


# Main Lists

The lists are [[unmoderated]] and most of them are hosted on
<http://lists.gnu.org/>.  Try to post to the appropriate mailing list.

Some of the Hurd user groups listed on [[community]] also host additional
mailing lists.

# Spam

GNU mailing lists used to have no spam filtering applied -- everyone was
allowed to post, the lists were completely unmoderated.  This resulted in
getting the lists spammed very much, as you can see in the web archives.  If
you're interested in getting hold of (mostly) spam-free mboxes, then talk to
[[Thomas_Schwinge|tschwinge]].  Also [[read_about|unmoderated]] the
spam-rejection techniques being used today.
