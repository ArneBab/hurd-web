Names are bindings to objects, however, to find an object
given a name, the relation must be looked up in a
naming context.  A problem with using string as names is
that it is very easy to lose track of the correct naming
context.  This is one of the problem with [[PassiveTranslators]]:
a passive translator is a string.  When the node is accessed
on which the passive translator is set and there is no active
translator, then an active translator is started using the
passive translator setting.  The active translator is started
by the file system, not the program instance that set the
passive translator.  The passive translator settings are
therefore resolved in the file system's naming context, which
may be different from that of the program instance that set the
passive translator setting.
