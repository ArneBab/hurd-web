Welcome to the **new** [GNU Hurd](http://hurd.gnu.org/) wiki!

There a huge bunch of unpolished stuff on here, please help to tidy things up.

Copyright notes are missing.  [[tschwinge]] is working on getting them back.
The wiki pages' content should be usable to the conditions as stated in the
[GNU FDL 1.2](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).  Contact [[tschwinge]] if
there are questions.

See [[HowToContributeToThisWiki]] for advice about -- well, you guessed it
already.

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does too.

What follows is a rough, mostly unedited copy of the original page being served
from <http://hurd.gnufans.org/>, the 2007-08-07 version.

**Welcome!**

Sporadic efforts by numerous individuals have been made to keep the information
on this site current. The hope that the primary development team would make
this a canonical source has not been fulfilled. While some of the information
and links here are still valid, unfortunately much is not.

This site focuses on providing a user-centric & update-able (hopefully the most
current) information possible regarding the status and development of the GNU
project's GNU operating system.  There are many areas to comment on the core
component (the Hurd) and other very closely related but distinct projects.
This is an all volunteer effort intended to supplement the [official Hurd
site](http://hurd.gnu.org/).

## I want to install the Hurd on my system. Where do I start?

You must use the Grub Boot Loader (not Lilo) to boot a Debian GNU/Hurd system.
A total of two gigabytes of unpartitioned disk space is enough for an
installation.  The best installation information is [available
here](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install).  There are also a couple
different [[Hurd_FAQs|Hurd/FrequentlyAskedQuestions]], an
[[irc_channel|Hurd/HurdIRC]] and several different
[[mailing_lists|Hurd/MailLists]] with searchable archives.  Please make an
attempt to answer your own questions first using archives, this site or drop by
the irc channel (if someone is online that can answer your question).  Any
possible coding time (resources) available to the core developers can then be
spent working on the tough [[problems_remaining|Hurd/KnownHurdLimits]] with the
architecture.

[[Hurd|Hurd/WebHome]]


## What specifically is the Hurd?

The [[Hurd|Hurd/WebHome]] is the GNU replacement for UNIX and Linux kernels.
It is a collection of servers that run on top of the [[GNU_Mach|Mach/WebHome]]
microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control,
and other features that are today implemented by the Unix, Linux or other
kernels.

The word *Hurd* is commonly used to refer to one of the following:

  * the Hurd software that runs on top of a microkernel (most precisely)
  * a machine running the [[Debian_GNU/Hurd|Distrib/WebHome]] distribution
  * the [GNU Hurd](http://hurd.gnu.org/) project including related dependent
    projects
  * HIRD of UNIX Replacing Daemons (arguably)
    * HIRD is an acronym for HURD Interfaces Representing Depth (arguably)

The [[Hurd|Hurd/WebHome]] supplies the last piece needed for a complete
[[GNU|GNU/WebHome]] operating system as originally conceived by Richard M
Stallman (RMS) in 1983.  The GNU vision directly drove the creation and has
guided the evolution of the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/),
the organization that is the home of the entire [GNU
project](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/).

[[Hurd/HurdNames]]


## What's the current status of the Hurd?

An *official 1.0 release* has been a dream since 1983.  Project resources are
scarce.  A precise time estimate is not possible.  The project welcomes any
assistance you can provide.  Porting and development expertise is still badly
needed in many key areas.

Functional systems are installable in a dual-boot configuration.  Development
systems are currently mostly based on the [[Debian_GNU/Hurd|Distrib/WebHome]]
port sponsored by the [Debian project](http://www.debian.org/).

Community resources for related projects focus around the official website
<http://hurd.gnu.org/>, this site at <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/>, the
[[mailing_lists|Hurd/MailLists]] and the [[irc_channel|Hurd/HurdIRC]].

## Can I add some information to the pages here?

Yes, this is very much encouraged!

Please see [[HowToContributeToThisWiki]] for information.

Every page on the site is editable.  Feel free to join in, but we do have some
simple requests.  In an ideal wiki, everyone is equal and shares equal rights,
liberties, responsibilities and common sense.  Please try to match the *tone*
of your topics and edits with the existing topics.  If we all pull in the same
direction the site will be more useful for everyone, especially for our own
use.


## How is this site arranged?

The menu on the upper right corner provides a rough structuring about the
available content.  Just follow those topics and explore the wiki.

Further information about this site and how it was created can be found in the
[[Wiki_Colophon|Main/TWikiColophon]].
