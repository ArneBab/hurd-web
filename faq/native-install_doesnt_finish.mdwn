Copying baseGNU to the virtual disk works. Even booting got through but when I
try to run native-install it never gets to the very end. First time it froze on
*sed* package, the other time on *sysv-rc*.

> How much memory did you configure for the [[QEMU]] system?  It may simply be
> -- I've seen this myself -- that the system runs out of memory, as at the
> native-install stage (I think at least) swap is not yet configured and
> enabled.  What I've been doing is: boot (with -s), MAKEDEV hdWHATEVER in

> /dev/hdWHATEVER.  Does this help?

>> Thank You very much, more memory solved the freezing.
