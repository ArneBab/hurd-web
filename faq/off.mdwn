[[!meta title="shutdown does not work, how am I supposed to shut my Hurd system down?"]]

The GNU/Hurd does not use SYSV runlevels, so commands like

    # shutdown -h now

will not work. Simply use the equivalent shortcuts

    # halt
    # reboot

to respectively shutdown and reboot Hurd, provided natively,
instead of from SYSV runlevels.

[[!tag open_issue_gnumach]]
GNU Mach does not have APM or ACPI support, so it will just stop with
`In tight loop: hit ctl-alt-del to reboot`, and you can switch off the
system.
