[[!meta title="apt: unmount cdroms"]]

You can add a shell script umount so that apt can automatically unmount cdroms.

    #!/bin/sh
    # Filename: /usr/bin/umount
    
    settrans -fg "$@"

Give executable permission to the script.

    # chmod +x /usr/bin/umount

In `/etc/fstab` add a trailing `/` after cdrom like `/cdrom/` since apt uses a
trailing `/`.
