\#hurd IRC channel on Freenode, 2010-12-21:

    <antrik> tschwinge: the writeup ignores the fact that POSIX compatibility
      is not only for applications, but also for users familiar with the UNIX
      environment
    <antrik> also, I still don't buy the fact that most software is not written
      for POSIX. even if assuming that GNOME programs don't use POSIX (which is
      only half true), there is a lot of other software in a system that is
      just as important, though less visible
    <antrik> (server software, startup system, device management, automation,
      ...)
    <antrik> tschwinge: BTW, I meant to (and partially did) write a blog
      article on this topic -- but I didn't get around to finish it...
