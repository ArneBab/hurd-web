[[!meta title="How many developers are working on the GNU Hurd?"]]

Not many.  One handful work on it in their free time, and another two
handful do help with [[Debian GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] and
[[hurd/running/Arch_Hurd]] packaging.  Also, an additional handful of
former developers are still available for answering technical questions,
but are not really participating in the current development anymore.

For reaching out to new developers, we're participating in [[Google's
Summer of Code program|community/gsoc]].  Likewise, any interested party
(*you*!) are very welcome to start [[contributing]].  Mentoring is
possible, too, to help you get started.

Continue reading some speculation about [[why so few developers]] are working
on the GNU Hurd.
