[[!meta title="How many developers are working on the GNU Hurd, and why so
few?"]]


# How Many Developers?

One handful works on the core of the system in their free time, and another
handful helps with [[Debian GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] and
[[hurd/running/Arch_Hurd]] packaging.  Also, an additional handful of former
developers are still available for answering technical questions, but are not
participating in the current development anymore.


# Why So Few?

We can only speculate.  One major problem might be that the [[architectural
benefits|advantages]] are generally perceived as very abstract, with little
practical benefit.  We currently don't have many tools that are actually making
use of all the possibilities.

Another reason is that it's been taking too long.  Today, most people don't
believe it will ever be ready for production use, and thus would consider
involvement a waste of time.  This latter point is invalid, of course, as
learning can never be a waste of time.  The same holds for the [[challenges]]
raised by the GNU Hurd -- we can only learn and improve upon working on them.


# Attracting New Faces

We're an open project: any interested party (*you*!) are very welcome to start
[[contributing]].  Mentoring is possible, too, to help you get started.

Likewise, for reaching out to new developers, we're participating in [[Google's
Summer of Code program|community/gsoc]].
