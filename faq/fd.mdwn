[[!meta title="I'm getting I/O eror, dev 02:00, sector 0"]]

dev 02:00 is the floppy drive. This message simply means that reading the floppy
was attempted, but no floppy disk was inserted, so it failed. It commonly
happens during installer disk detection, or grub setup, and is completely
harmless.

To avoid it, you can as well remove `/dev/fd0` (do you really have a floppy
around you anyway?)
