In order to [[debug|debugging]] translators and being able to step into glibc
during it, you need the `hurd-dbg` and `libc0.3-dbg` packages installed.  If you need to debug the initialization of the translator,
start the translator like `settrans -P /foo /usr/bin/env
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/usr/lib/debug /hurd/foofs`. The `-P` option will make it
pause and you will be able to attach [[debugging/GDB]] to the process.
