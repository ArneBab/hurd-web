    <antrik> gnu_srs1: regarding your question why people aren't interested in
      workin on Hurd: Eric Raymond explains it pretty well in his famous
      "Cathedral and Bazaar" paper
    <antrik> people are more likely to work on something that *almost* works
      for them, and where they only have to fill in a few missing bits
    <antrik> the Hurd doesn't almost work for anyone
    <antrik> actually, you should probably reread the whole paper. it's
      essentially an analysis why the Hurd failed compared to Linux
