    <veganman> sothere's absolutelyno way,evenslowly to run i386 linuxcode
      under hurd/i386? Ihave a small app, commercial, which I have to get
      running there
    <veganman> no source
    <braunr> no way
    <braunr> you'd need to create a userspace linux server catching linux
      system calls and calling hurd specific stuff to implement them
    <braunr> it doesn't exist, it may be hard to implement
    <braunr> some cases will definitely be hard to implement
    <veganman> so, no magic linux lxemu on windows?
    <veganman> or linuxemu on plan9
    <pinotree> nope
    <veganman> I remember somethingsilly, sonmone hadcompiled linux asauser
      applicationon plan9 and inserted his own binaries as
      acodeobject,toberunon plan9, for useon ibm hpc hatrdware
    <veganman> it was ron minich
    <veganman> 5e.iwp9.org/slides/linuxemu.pdf
    <veganman> I think that was it
    <veganman> google for linux & cnk for additional clues
