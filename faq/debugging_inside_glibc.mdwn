In Debian, to get [[debugging]] information for glibc, you need to install the
`libc0.3-dbg` package.  At the place [[debugging/GDB]] looks for debugging
symbols by default (`/usr/lib/debug/lib/`), Debian's `libc0.3-dbg` stores only
the frame unwind information used for backtracing.  If you want to step into
glibc while debugging, you need to add `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug` to
debugged program's environment (`set env VAR value` from the GDB command line).
If that still does not work, try `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/debug/libc.so.0.3`
instead.
