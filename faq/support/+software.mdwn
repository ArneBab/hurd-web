[[!meta title="What software is available for GNU?"]]

  * Most (3/4) packages from [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) [GNU/Linux](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) which aren't linux-specific ([Packages That Won't Be Ported](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-devel-debian)) are expected to work on GNU/Hurd too. See the database in <http://packages.debian.org/>. Notably, [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org), and [KDE](http://www.kde.org) work. See the [[porting/guidelines]] document for some common build problems and their solutions.
  * If you can't fetch a package with "apt-get install ", try building it from source: "apt-get source  &amp;&amp; cd &lt;package\_dir&gt; &amp;&amp; debian/rules binary".
  * As of March 2013, 78% of Debian packages have been ported on the Hurd. Of course, bug testing is welcome.
