[[!meta title="Is there a 64bit version?"]]

There are currently no plan for 64bit userland, but there are plans for 64bit
kernelland + 32bit userland, which will notably permit to efficiently make use
of more than 2GiB memory and provide 4GiB userland addressing space. Work on
this is currently in branches in GNU Mach.
