[[!meta title="Is there a 64-bit version?"]]

There are currently no plan for 64-bit userland, but there are plans for 64-bit
kernelland with 32-bit userland, which will notably permit to efficiently make
use of more than 2 GiB memory and provide 4 GiB userland addressing space.
Work on this is currently in branches for GNU Mach.
