As of March 2013, 78% of Debian packages have been ported on the Hurd. Of
course, bug testing and fixing is welcome, as we have obviously not tested all
of them.

Most packages from [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
[GNU/Linux](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html)
which aren't linux-specific (see [Packages That Won't Be
Ported](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-devel-debian))
are expected to work on GNU/Hurd too. See the database in
<http://packages.debian.org/>. Notably, [Xorg](http://www.x.org/),
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/), [KDE](http://www.kde.org/), firefox work. See
the [[porting/guidelines]] document for some common build problems and their
solutions.
