[[!meta title="What drivers does GNU/Hurd have?"]]

Currently, for disks Mach integrates drivers from Linux 2.0 through some
[[community/gsoc/project_ideas/driver_glue_code]].  As it's very old, that
limits hardware support a lot, of course.  For network boards, we use the
[[DDE]] toolkit to run linux 2.6.32 drivers in userland processes,
which provides both long-term support for new hardware and safety against driver
bugs.  [[microkernel/mach/gnumach/ports/Xen]] is also supported, both blkfront
and netfront.

Note however that we have of course not tested all drivers, we obviously don't
even have all kinds of hardware. So we can not promise that they will all
work. What probably works for sure is what we usually use: the rtl8139 or e1000
drivers for instance.
