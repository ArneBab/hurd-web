IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-01-21:

    <chromaticwt> is it possible to transfer servers running on one microkernel
      on one machine, to another microkernel running on a different machine?
    <chromaticwt> two machines will be running the complete os
    <antrik> well, if the code for network-transparent IPC still existed, it
      might be possible to move a task to another machine, while keeping the
      port associations with the original system...
    <antrik> if you mean actually moving it to another system, that's pretty
      much impossible in any system that has stateful interfaces
