[[!meta title="Are SATA disk drives supported?"]]

GNU Mach does not support SATA disk drives (`/dev/sda` etc. in GNU/Linux)
natively, so using `device:sd0s1` will not work, as sd* devices are for SCSI
drives only.
The only way to get those drives to work is to put them into compatibility mode
in the BIOS, if such an option exists.  GNU Mach will then recognize them as hda etc.
