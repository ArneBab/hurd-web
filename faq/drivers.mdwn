[[!meta title="what hardware is supported? What drivers does GNU/Hurd have?"]]

Currently, for disks Mach integrates old drivers from Linux through some
[[community/gsoc/project_ideas/driver_glue_code]], which provide
IDE disk support, and we have an AHCI driver which provides [[SATA
support|faq/sata_disk_drives]]. For network boards, we use the [[DDE]] toolkit
to run linux 2.6.32 drivers in userland processes, which provides both long-term
support for new hardware and safety against driver bugs.  Note however that we
have of course not tested all drivers, we obviously don't even have all kinds of
hardware.  So we can not promise that they will all work. What probably
works for sure is what we usually use: the rtl8139 and e1000 drivers for
instance. Firmware loading is not implemented yet.

[[microkernel/mach/gnumach/ports/Xen]] is also supported, both blkfront and
netfront.
