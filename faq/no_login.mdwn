If logging in doesn't work, e.g. you enter a username, and it doesn't even
prompt for a password, but directly say "Invalid password", you probably have
some translators which got deconfigured for some reason. You can try to reboot in emergency mode, and run

    # dpkg-reconfigure hurd

to reinstall translators.
