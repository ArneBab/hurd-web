[[!meta title="What is GHAMP?"]]

*GHAMP* is the GNU/Hurd-based Apache, MySQL, PHP solution stack -- analoguous
to GLAMP, which is based on GNU/Linux.

Pronounce it like the *G* in
[GNU](http://www.gnu.org/pronunciation/pronunciation.html), followed by a
mostly silent *H*, and *AMP* as in amplifier.
