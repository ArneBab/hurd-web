[[!meta title="Getting Assertion `__pthread_threads' failed."]]

Some applications don't link against libpthread, but load plugins which do link against libpthread. This means unexpectedly switch from mono-thread to multi-thread. This is not supported yet, thus the following error:

    ./pthread/../sysdeps/generic/pt-mutex-timedlock.c:70: __pthread_mutex_timedlock_internal: Assertion `__pthread_threads' failed.

This can be worked around by using

export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/i386-gnu/libpthread.so.0.3
