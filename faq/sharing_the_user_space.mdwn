*Question:* Could it be possible to have a system installation where you can
dual-boot using either the [[Linux]] kernel, or the GNU Hurd, so that
everything but the kernel is shared?

*Answer:* Given that both Linux and GNU Hurd are using the [[ELF]] binary
format, this could indeed be made possible, if all programs agreed to rely on
only one abstraction layer, for example the standard C library ([[glibc]]).
(Additionally, for example for system calls that are not covered by glibc
calls, you'd need to be able to reliably trap and emulate these.)  However,
Linux' and the GNU Hurd's [[ABI]]'s have sufficiently diverged, so that this is
not easy to do.  That's why you can't currently install a system in this way,
but you need a separate installation of the userspace suited for the Linux
kernel, or the GNU Hurd.
