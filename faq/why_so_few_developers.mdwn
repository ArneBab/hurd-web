[[!meta title="Why are there so few developers working on the GNU
Hurd?"]]

[[There aren't working a lot of people on the GNU
Hurd|how_many_developers]].  Why is this?

We can only speculate.  One major problem might be that the
[[architectural benefits|advantages]] are generally perceived as very
abstract, with little practical benefits.  We don't have many tools to
present actually making use of the possibilities.

Another reason is that it's been taking too long.  Most people don't
believe it will ever be ready for production use, and thus would consider
involvement a waste of time.  This latter point is invalid, of course, as
learning can never be a waste of time.  The same holds for the
[[challenges]] raised by the GNU Hurd -- we can only learn and improve
upon working on them.
