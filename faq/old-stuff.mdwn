In addition to the [general FAQ](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/docs.html#TOCfaq) there are the following typical newbie questions. (There is an [updated version](http://tuxou.ouvaton.org/hurd/) which is not official yet.)

If you still have problems, do not hesitate to make use of the [[mailing lists]] or the [[IRC]].

* **_You say GNU, don't you mean GNU/Hurd?_**
  * Yes and no. GNU refers to the system as a whole, while GNU/Hurd is more specific, saying that it is the GNU system running on the Hurd -- to differentiate it from the GNU system running on Linux, GNU/Linux.

* **_Why can't I get the answers I need from Hurd hackers?_**
  * This [document](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) may help you understand some developers attitudes and social norms.

* **_Where are the virtual consoles I use when running Linux?_**
  * The userland [[console]] provides it. You could still [use screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q4-6) of course.

* **_What is a translator?_**
  * The official FAQ [answers](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q4-2) this question by a reference to [hurd-doc-translator](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-translator).

* **_Where's the sauce?_**
  * It's on [Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org). See also the [GNU Development Resources](http://www.gnu.org/software/devel.html), for more information.

* **_What is GNU Mach vs. oskit-mach?_**
  * There used to be different versions of the Mach microkernel that supported the Hurd that runs on top of it. We currently only use GNU Mach. For more info, see [[Mach]]

* **_What software is available for GNU?_**
  * Most (3/4) packages from [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) [GNU/Linux](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) which aren't linux-specific ([Packages That Won't Be Ported](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-devel-debian)) are expected to work on GNU/Hurd too. See the database in <http://packages.debian.org/>. Notably, [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org), and [KDE](http://www.kde.org) work. See the [[porting/guidelines]] document for some common build problems and their solutions.
  * If you can't fetch a package with "apt-get install ", try building it from source: "apt-get source  &amp;&amp; cd &lt;package\_dir&gt; &amp;&amp; debian/rules binary".
  * As of March 2013, 78% of Debian packages have been ported on the Hurd. Of course, bug testing is welcome.

* **_How do I initialize a serial console on the Hurd?_**
  * You can try out the Serial Howto at <http://www.nongnu.org/thug/serial-howto.txt>
  * For kernel messages, you can append `console=com0` to the kernel command line.
