[[!meta title="What software is available for GNU?"]]

As of March 2014, 79% of all [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
[packages](http://packages.debian.org/) are available for [[Debian
GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]].  Of course, testing and bug fixing is welcome,
as we have obviously not tested all of them.

Generally, packages
that aren't Linux-specific (see [Packages That Won't Be
Ported](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-devel-debian))
are expected to work on GNU/Hurd too.  Notably, [X.Org](http://www.x.org/),
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/), [KDE](http://www.kde.org/),
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox) work. See
the [[hurd/porting/guidelines]] document for some common build problems and their
solutions.
