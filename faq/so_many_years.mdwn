[[!meta title="Why is it that the Hurd still does not do [...] after so many
years of development?"]]

Remember that what counts is not just *years* but rather *years x people*, and
in this regard, the investment into GNU Hurd's development is way below that of
the Linux kernel or the BSDs.  Considering [[how_many_developers]] are (and
have been) working on the Hurd, it is actually impressive that so much has been
achieved in the past couple of decades with so few people.
