[[!meta title="How is it that the Hurd does not do foo and bar, after so many years of development?"]]


Remember that what counts is years.people, not just years, so it
can't be compared to e.g. Linux or BSD development so trivially. See
[[how_many_developers|how many developers]] are working on the Hurd, it is
actually impressive that so much has been done in the past couple of decades
with so few people.
