[[!meta title="Is there a 64-bit version?"]]

There are currently no plan for 64-bit userland, but there are plans for 64-bit
kernelland with 32-bit userland, which will notably permit to efficiently make
use of more than 2 GiB memory and provide 4 GiB userland addressing space.
[[Work on this|open_issues/64-bit_port]] is currently in the master-x86_64 and
port-amd64 branches for GNU Mach.

That being said, you can always run a 32-bit version on a 64-bit machine, it
just works, processes are just limited to a couple GiB available memory.
