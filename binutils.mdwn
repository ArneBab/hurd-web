# Specifics

Actually *non-*specifics: as these tools primarily deal with low-level parts of
the target architecture and the object file format (ELF ABI), which are
essentially (at least meant to be) the same, there shouldn't be many
differences comparing the binutils between the GNU/Hurd and GNU/Linux ports,
for example.
