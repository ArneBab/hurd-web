Some of the GNU software effects the Hurd development directly or indirectly. Here's a place for notes about these changes. The official sources are the GNU software [Directory](http://www.gnu.org/directory/) (sponsored by the UN!), [Projects](http://www.gnu.org/projects/), [Packaging](http://www.gnu.org/software/packaging/) and [savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org/) pages, but this page is for Hurd related notes about them.
