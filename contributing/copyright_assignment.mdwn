If you have pieces of code or documentation to contribute, then, in order to
install them into our [[source_repositories]], you have to assign the copyright
of your changes to the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/).

The assignment for [[GNU Mach|microkernel/mach/gnumach]] additionally covers
[[microkernel/mach/mig/GNU_MIG]] (which used to be a component of GNU Mach, and
logically still is).

The assignment for [[GNU Hurd|hurd]] additionally covers the separate
[[source_repositories/incubator]], [[libpthread]], [[hurd/translator/procfs]],
[[hurd/translator/unionfs]], [[microkernel/viengoos]],
[[web|contributing/web_pages]] repositories, and possibly more.

Amongst others, the assignments for [[binutils]], [[GCC]], [[GDB]], [[glibc]]
are separate ones.

Please [[contact_us]] to request the needed forms.
