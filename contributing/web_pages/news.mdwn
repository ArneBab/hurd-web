[[!meta title="""How to prepare and publish a "Quarter of the Hurd" for the last
quarter"""]]

We prepare a *Quarter of the Hurd* in the file [[qoth_next]].  The idea is
to record to-be-published changes in that file at they time they arise, and
then publish them en bloc at the end of the quarter.  There are instructions for
[[writing_the_qoth]].

  * At the end of the quarter: prepare for publishing the QotH, then send the raw
    Markdown text to the mailing list, asking for feedback.

  * ..., and publish.

        $ git mv contributing/web_pages/news/qoth_next.mdwn news/YYYY-MM.mdwn

    Edit the news entry's *meta date* value to the timestamp when the news
    entry is published.  We have to set that one manually, as otherwise the
    timestamp of the news entry file's creation will be taken, which is (much)
    earlier, and not what we want.  We do not set the *meta updated* value, as
    it's correct to update that one upon further modifications of the news
    entries.

        $ git cp contributing/web_pages/news/skeleton.mdwn contributing/web_pages/news/qoth_next.mdwn
        $ git commit -m 'QotH YYYY-MM.'
        $ git push origin master
