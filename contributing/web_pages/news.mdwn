[[!meta title="""How to prepare and publish "a month of the Hurd" for the last
month"""]]

We prepare *A Month of the Hurd* in the file [[contributing/web_pages/news/news_moth_next]].  The idea is
to record to-be-published changes in that file at they time they arise, and
then publish them en bloc at the end of the month.

* At the end of the month: prepare for publishing the news

    Edit the news entry's *meta date* value to the timestamp when the news
    entry is [[published|news]].  We have to set that one manually, as
    otherwise the timestamp of the news entry file's creation will be taken,
    which is (much) earlier, and not what we want.  We do not set the *meta
    updated* value, as it's correct to update that one upon further
    modifications of the news entries. 

* Then send it to the mailing list, include all feedback ... 

* ... and publish

        $ git cp contributing/web_pages/news/news_moth_next news/yyyy-mm
        $ git commit -m "Added MotH yyyy-mm"
        $ git push origin master
