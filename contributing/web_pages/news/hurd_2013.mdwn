It is with huge pleasure that the Debian GNU/Hurd port announces the 
**release of Debian GNU/Hurd 2013**.  
This is a snapshot of Debian sid at the time of the Debian
Wheezy release (May 2013), so it is mostly based on Wheezy.  It is *not* an
official Debian release, but it is an official Debian GNU/Hurd port release.

The installation ISO images can be downloaded from
[[Debian Ports|http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian-cd/hurd-i386/current/]]
with the usual 3 Debian flavors: NETINST, CD, or DVD. Besides the friendly
Debian installer, a pre-installed disk image is also available to make trying
Debian GNU/Hurd even easier.

Debian GNU/Hurd it's currently available for the i386 architecture with more
than 10.000 software packages available (> 75% of the Debian archive, and more
to come!).

Please make sure to read the
[[configuration information|http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install]],
the [[FAQ|faq]],
and the [[translator primer|hurd/documentation/translator_primer]]
for a start.

Due to the very small number of developers,
our progress of the project has not been as fast as other successful
Operating Systems, but we believe to have reached a very good
state, even with the limited resources.

We would like to thank all the people who have worked on GNU/Hurd over the past
decades. There were not many people at any given time (and still not many people
today, please [[join|contributing]]!), but in the end a lot of people have
contributed one way or the other. **Thanks everybody!**

The **GNU Hurd** is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.  It is a
collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file
systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are
implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).  [[More
detailed|hurd/documentation]].

**GNU Mach** is the microkernel upon which a GNU Hurd system is based.  It
provides an Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that the Hurd uses to
define interfaces for implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the
services a traditional operating system kernel provides.  [[More
detailed|microkernel/mach/gnumach]].
