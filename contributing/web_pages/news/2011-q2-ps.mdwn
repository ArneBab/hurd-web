After our last *[[Quarter of the Hurd|news/2011-q2]]* has been picked
up by a bunch of news sites, blogs, and so on, discussions have been
running all over the net *([lwn][], [reddit1][], [reddit2][],
[h-online][], [slashdot][], [golem1][], [golem2][],
[ih][innocenthacker], [netzwelt][], [tunnelbau][],
[pro-linux][], [srini][], [schmehl][], …)*.  We are happy to see that there is
considerable interest in the Hurd; but we also saw some
misunderstandings, false rumors, and outdated information floating
around.  Thus we will try to clarify the situation regarding some of
the more common misunderstandings.

  * **Debian GNU Hurd works to become a port in Debian**:
    We plan to get into the next Debian release (Wheezy)
    as an additional port alongside GNU/Linux and GNU/kFreeBSD --
    but we don't know yet whether we will make it.
    There is still substantial work necessary to indeed become a release candidate.
    If you
    want to help, please see our [[contributing]] page and the *to do*
    list maintained on <http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/Hurd>.  We'd
    be happy to have you on board!

  * **Java support for GNU/Hurd is nearby**: Jérémie Koenig is working
    on making a versatile Java programming environment available on
    the GNU/Hurd as part of his
    [[Google Summer of Code project|user/jkoenig/java]], focussing on
    OpenJDK 7 --
    [partially working packages](http://jk.fr.eu.org/debian/experimental/)
    are already available.
    He also implemented GCJ/ECJ support,
    though this is not yet fully functional either.
    <!-- Is this correct? What is the actual status? -->

  * **GNU/Hurd supports X.Org, though a bit unstable**:
    X support has been present for ages
    (anyone remember
    [1998's XFree86](http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/hurd/hurd_video.c?rev=1.1&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup)?);
    and X.Org also has been supported for a long time.
    (It's even mentioned in the
    [X.Org 7.2 release announcement](http://www.x.org/wiki/Other/Press/X11R72Released?action=show&redirect=PressReleases%2FX11R72Released).)
    It is true though that many modern drivers do not work anymore,
    as they require DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) support now;
    so often only VESA is available.
    Also, X on the Hurd is [[somewhat_unstable|hurd/status]].

  * **The Hurd has weaker device support than Linux**:
    Most of the drivers we use today were imported from Linux 2.0.x.
    For network cards,
    Linux 2.6.29 drivers are available through [[DDE|hurd/dde]] --
    however, this is not fully integrated yet,
    so using these drivers needs manual setup for now.
    Support for other driver types is also possible with DDE,
    but it requires some not-trivial work for each additional class of drivers --
    so this can take some time to become available.
    (An additional benefit provided by DDE is that the device drivers run in userspace --
    unlike the old drivers we were using so far,
    which are part of the underlying Mach microkernel.)

  * **The Hurd has SMP, but needs support for new chipsets**:
    Both Mach (the microkernel used by the Hurd),
    and the Hurd servers themselves come with SMP support.
    However, Mach [[misses drivers for modern SMP chipsets|faq/smp]];
    and there are also some SMP-related bugs in the implementation --
    so further work is needed
    for the Hurd to take advantage of modern multicore processors.

  * **Given the available manpower, the progress is very good**:
    Over the past decade,
    there were seldom more than half a dozen developers at any given time
    hacking on the Hurd, in their spare time --
    not hundreds of paid developers like Linux has.
    Considering this, the progress made is quite encouraging;
    with the system being [[pretty usable|hurd/status]] for many day-to-day tasks now.
    It is generally understood that the ambitious architecture of the Hurd
    required a lot of effort to get it working at all --
    but the recent progress shows that once the foundations are in place,
    the Hurd design indeed allows the developers to be very productive.

  * **Installation can still be challenging**:
    Please [[take notice|http://xkcd.com/293/]] of the
    [README file](http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-i386/installer/cdimage/YES_REALLY_README.txt) --
    just like with any software in development,
    there are some known pitfalls to avoid.
    (Or better yet, help to fix :-) )
    Alternatively, you can simply use the the
    [preinstalled image](http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.gz).

  * **GNU Hurd is not the same as GNU/Hurd**:
    The GNU project set out in 1983 to create a complete free operating system.
    When a distribution such as Debian combines their GNU-based userland
    with the GNU kernel (named `GNU Hurd`),
    the result is more or less a full GNU system.
    However, such third-party distributions are distinct
    from what an afficial complete GNU system release would be;
    and thus we often call them `GNU/Hurd`
    (in contrast to `GNU/Linux` or `GNU/kFreeBSD`) for clarity.

  * **Performance**:
    The [benchmarks conducted by Phoronix](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=debian_gnu_hurd&num=1)
    attested very good performance to the Hurd.
    Keep in mind though that these benchmarks were almost completely CPU-bound;
    so they essentially just confirm that we don't do anything stupid
    regarding CPU intialisation. (Cache setup etc.)
    The results would be different for benchmarks
    that actually exercise the operating system functionality more.
    The fact that the tests were performed in a virtualised environment,
    might also have helped the results,
    for example by mitigating the effects of our unoptimized I/O paths --
    which are currently the major bottleneck in most situations.
    Nevertheless, these results are a hint
    that the extra IPC required in microkernel systems
    [doesn't necessarily hamper performance](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.51.16)
    quite as much as often believed.
    We are glad to see such solid benchmarks
    help dispell some of the myths around the Hurd :-)

IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-08-24:

    < ArneBab> hurd related: I now think you were right, antrik: the hurd
      rumors don't belong into the news (tschwinge)
    < antrik> ArneBab: you mean the postscriptum as a whole, or just the wild
      rumours part?...
    < ArneBab> the whole PS
    < ArneBab> it should rather go into a blog post
    < ArneBab> (in the wiki)
    < antrik> hm... I don't think I agree
    < ArneBab> why?
    < antrik> apparently there is a number of people following the news now,
      and apparently many of them misread some statements... it makes sense to
      use the same channel for clarifying them I'd say
    < ArneBab> hm, ok
    < ArneBab> how would you select the part to include?
    < antrik> roughly speaking, I'd include everything that actually relates to
      the previous news that were misunderstood
    < antrik> and drop all unrelated speculations that popped up
    < antrik> BTW, it *might* be useful perhaps to actually update the original
      news posting with the clarifications?...
    < ArneBab> we can't do that without breaking some peoples RSS feeds
    < antrik> note that there is another aspect to consider: the fact that
      several news sites picked it up is indeed genuine news by itself...
    < ArneBab> that's right, yes
    < antrik> will it really break anything? from what I heard so far it just
      means they will see the posting as new again, which would actually make
      sense in this case...
    < antrik> but I don't insist if you think it's too risky :-)
    < antrik> just an idea
