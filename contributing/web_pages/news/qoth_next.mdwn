<!--basic structure of a QotH entry. Adapt, reduce and add points as needed. At the end, try to make the text flow as a unified whole.-->

* Jeremie Koenig released the final report on his GSoC project Java on Hurd http://www.bddebian.com/~hurd-web/user/jkoenig/java/report along with a summary of his changes and the challenges he bested http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-01/msg00062.html .

* Richard Braun [libpcap](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-01/msg00059.html) bringing wireshark and [pcap_inject](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00000.html) for easier network testing.

* Samuel Thibault prepared dde in incubator, making about half the Linux network drivers compile on the Hurd http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-02/msg00037.html . Also he added the netdde debian package and testing notes http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-02/msg00038.html . 

* Peter O'Gorman pushed the fix from Samuel Thibault to fix libtool on the Hurd. http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-02/msg00023.html

* Samuel Thibault merged the slab branch, finishing Maksym Planetas GSoC work on a better memory allocator http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-02/msg00010.html .

* Thomas Schwinge [moved](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00063.html) the translators [cvsfs](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/incubator.git/log/?h=cvsfs/master), [libfuse](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/incubator.git/log/?h=libfuse/master) and [smbfs](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/incubator.git/log/?h=smbfs/master) into the incubator git repository, reducing the barrier of entry to improving them, so integrating cvs and samba in the filesystem and using FUSE translators can be stabilized more easily.

* Svante Signell [added](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00060.html) the basics of ADA support by making gnat build. This gives us the option to use provable programs optimized for embedded systems with the Hurd.

* Maksym Planeta published some [performance tests of tmpfs](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00040.html), showing a speedup from 22s with ramfs and ext2fs to 16s with tmpfs for apt-get calls. An obvious usecase for tmpfs are [faster Hurd LiveCDs](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00050.html).

* Samuel Thibault [improved debugging in GNU Mach](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00032.html) by making the debugger aware of the difference between kernel space and user space. This should substantially reduce the development time for features in Mach by giving [nicer stack traces](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00047.html).

* Ludovic Courtès added [a continuous testing framework](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00019.html) using a Nix-based GNU QEMU image. Since Hurd can now be built using „Nix“ (german for nothing), how about asking a colleague to revise his image of the Hurd as vaporware and showing him vapor chugging away on a compile of your favorite free program? If you don’t want to install it yourself, you can also check the [automatic tests on hydra](http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/hurd-master) ([background](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00104.html)).

* Ludovic Courtes [fixed invalid port deallocation in `symlink'](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00013.html) and [made console-run resilient against missing /dev/console](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-03/msg00002.html), improving the overall reliability of the system.

* Pino Toscano  improved the POSIX compliance of the Hurd [for nanosleep](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00130.html) [ptsname_r](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00122.html), 
[getlogin_r](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00121.html), [getgroups](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00120.html) and [sendto](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-06/msg00009.html), making it easier to port POSIX programs.

* Richard brown improved memory mapping [with a red-black tree](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00109.html), which should speed up memory access.

* Thomas Schwinge [improved the Hurd build system](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00087.html), making it easier to get in: „running autoreconf is all you need“.

* Thomas DiModica [merged](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-06/msg00018.html) the cthreads to pthreads patch to Hurd master and [added a branch for it](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-07/msg00087.html) to make it easier to work on getting Hurd to use the more current pthreads.

* Samuel Thibault [added TLS support](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-05/msg00046.html) to Hurd, getting us up to date with the standard of secure networking.

* Roland McGrath [merged many libc changes](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-05/msg00033.html) for upstream inclusion, reducing the maintenance load for getting recent improvements of libc.

* Samuel Thibault [made iconx build](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-06/msg00004.html), which fullfills a requirement for FTBFS.

------ Q3 ------

* Richard Braun [added a VM page cache](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-07/msg00031.html) for better response times of the Hurd - along with fixes to bugs in several programs exposed by the increased freedom of the memory allocation of the kernel.

* Pino Toscano  improved the POSIX compliance of the Hurd for [fsync](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-08/msg00067.html) and
[ptrace](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-08/msg00068.html), making it easier to port POSIX programs.

Now, as a final note, we want to share a story about real-life debugging with the
Hurd; IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-03-02:

    <youpi> yay GNU/Hurd  
    <youpi> I have added i_translator check in e2fsck, it was missing  
    <youpi> I had a volume that was keeping making ext2fs crash  
    <youpi> with a reproductible scenario  
    <youpi> could easily work out it was i_translator, then add a
      check to e2fsck, run it, which indeed fixed, them, and voilà,
      ext2fs was working again
    <youpi> all that on the same machine with *no* system reboot  
    <youpi> just ext2fs restart :)


So if you want to [reason for contibuting to the Hurd],
please [[get in contact|contact_us]] -- and maybe already grab the [[source
code|source_repositories]].

The **GNU Hurd** is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.  It is a
collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file
systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are
implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).  [[More
detailed|hurd/documentation]].

**GNU Mach** is the microkernel upon which a GNU Hurd system is based.  It
provides an Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that the Hurd uses to
define interfaces for implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the
services a traditional operating system kernel provides.  [[More
detailed|microkernel/mach/gnumach]].
