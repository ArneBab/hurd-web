Now, as a final note, we want to share a story about real-life debugging with the
Hurd; IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-03-02:

    <youpi> yay GNU/Hurd  
    <youpi> I have added i_translator check in e2fsck, it was missing  
    <youpi> I had a volume that was keeping making ext2fs crash  
    <youpi> with a reproductible scenario  
    <youpi> could easily work out it was i_translator, then add a
      check to e2fsck, run it, which indeed fixed, them, and voilà,
      ext2fs was working again
    <youpi> all that on the same machine with *no* system reboot  
    <youpi> just ext2fs restart :)


So if you want to [reason for contibuting to the Hurd],
please [[get in contact|contact_us]] -- and maybe already grab the [[source
code|source_repositories]].

The **GNU Hurd** is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.  It is a
collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file
systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are
implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).  [[More
detailed|hurd/documentation]].

**GNU Mach** is the microkernel upon which a GNU Hurd system is based.  It
provides an Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that the Hurd uses to
define interfaces for implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the
services a traditional operating system kernel provides.  [[More
detailed|microkernel/mach/gnumach]].
