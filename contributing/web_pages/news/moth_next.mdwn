This month [hurd hacker]  [item]

**http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-11/msg00079.html**

Bouju Alain submitted a patch to suport cpuinfo in the /proc interface

**IRC 2011-11-14**
rbraun committed the last patch to mplanetas branch of the slab allocator work, for integration. 

Features:

(22:30:39) braunr: there shouldn't be any noticeable difference with the master branch

(22:30:46) braunr: a bit less fragmentation

(22:30:55) braunr: more memory can be reclaimed by the VM system

(22:31:02) braunr: there are debugging features

(22:31:06) braunr: it's SMP ready

(22:31:15) braunr: and overall cleaner than the zone allocator

(22:31:31) braunr: although a bit slower on the free path (because of what's performed to reduce fragmentation)

(22:32:42) braunr: but even "slower" here is completely negligible

------

The **GNU Hurd** is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.
It is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to
implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and
other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar
kernels (such as Linux).  
[[More_detailed|hurd/documentation]].

**GNU Mach** is the microkernel upon which GNU Hurd is based. It
offers Inter Process Communication (IPC) which the Hurd uses to define
interfaces for implementing the services an operating system needs
from a full-featured kernel.
