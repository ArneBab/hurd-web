This month [hurd hacker]  [item]

<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2011-11/msg00079.html> -- Bouju
Alain submitted a patch to suport cpuinfo in the /proc interface

rbraun committed the last patch to mplanetas branch of the slab allocator
work, for integration.

IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-11-14:

Features:

    (22:30:39) braunr: there shouldn't be any noticeable difference with the
      master branch
    (22:30:46) braunr: a bit less fragmentation
    (22:30:55) braunr: more memory can be reclaimed by the VM system
    (22:31:02) braunr: there are debugging features
    (22:31:06) braunr: it's SMP ready
    (22:31:15) braunr: and overall cleaner than the zone allocator
    (22:31:31) braunr: although a bit slower on the free path (because of
      what's performed to reduce fragmentation)
    (22:32:42) braunr: but even "slower" here is completely negligible

As a sidenote, we would like to share a story about real-life debugging with the Hurd:

    <youpi> yay GNU/Hurd
    <youpi> I have added i_translator check in e2fsck, it was missing
    <youpi> I had a volume that was keeping making ext2fs crash
    <youpi> with a reproductible scenario
    <youpi> could easily work out it was i_translator, then add a check to e2fsck, run it, which indeed fixed, them, and voilà, ext2fs was working again
    <youpi> all that on the same machine with *no* system reboot
    <youpi> just ext2fs restart :)

Add stuff here? (This is already in q3)

The **GNU Hurd** is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.  It is a
collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file
systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are
implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).  [[More
detailed|hurd/documentation]].

**GNU Mach** is the microkernel upon which a GNU Hurd system is based.  It
provides an Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that the Hurd uses to
define interfaces for implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the
services a traditional operating system kernel provides.  [[More
detailed|microkernel/mach/gnumach]].
