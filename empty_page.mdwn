HERE STARTS YOUR NEW CONTENT -- remove everything from here on, including this

We put in the above copyright and licensing header so that we'll easily be able
to include the text you contribute in official GNU documentation, such as the
GNU Hurd manuals, etc.

If this is absolutely not what you want then please refrain from changing the
above licensing conditions, but instead simply send email to
<hurd-maintainers@gnu.org> and we'll work on finding a solution.
