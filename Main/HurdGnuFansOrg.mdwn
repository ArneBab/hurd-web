## <a name="Welcome_to_http_hurd_gnufans_org"> </a> Welcome to <http://hurd.gnufans.org>!

This site focuses on providing the most current information possible regarding the status and development of the GNU project's GNU operating system, it's core component (the Hurd) and other closely related projects. It is a volunteer effort intended to supplement the official sites. It is a web-based collaboration effort powered by TWiki software installed in May, 2002.

## <a name="What_is_the_Hurd_"> What is the Hurd? </a>

The [[Hurd/WebHome]] is the GNU replacement for UNIX and Linux "kernels." It consists of a set of servers running on top of a microkernel. When coupled with the [[Mach/WebHome]] microkernel the Hurd supplies the last piece needed for a complete [[GNU/WebHome]] operating system as originally conceived by Richard M Stallman (RMS) in 1983. The GNU vision drove the creation of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The name Hurd is also commonly used to refer to machines running the [[Distrib/WebHome]].

## <a name="What_s_the_current_status_of_the"> What's the current status of the Hurd? </a>

Even most developers do not use it as their primary day to day operating system yet. Functional systems are currently being distributed in CD-ROM, tarball and Bochs system image formats. Development systems are currently based on a Debian GNU/Hurd port ([[Distrib/WebHome]]).

Community resources for related projects focus on the main [[Hurd/WebHome]], [[MailLists]] and [[HurdIRC]]. A good snapshot of activity can be found on the [IRC summary](http://web.walfield.org/~grant/hurd-irc-stats-thisweek.html), a 7-day snapshot of IRC discussions.

An "official 1.0 release" is hoped for sometime in 2003. Since project resources are scarce, a more precise time estimate is not possible. The project welcomes any assistance you can provide.

## <a name="Can_I_add_some_information_to_th"> Can I add some information to the pages here? </a>

Yes, this is encouraged. If you are not familiar with the TWiki collaboration tool (a Wiki type software implementation) and would like to contribute some content to the site, please visit [[TWiki/WelcomeGuest]] in the TWiki web first. Feel free to join in, but we do have some simple requests.

In our Wiki everyone is equal and shares equal rights, liberties and responsibilities. Please respect the guidelines described in the %TWIKIWEB%.GoodStyle. Also try to match the "tone" of your topics and edits with the existing topics. Further information about this site and how it was created can be found in the [[TWikiColophon]]. _We would prefer that you create your own [[Main/TWikiUsers]] on the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiRegistration page_. You may also use the [[Main/TWikiGuest]] account when commenting on topics.

## <a name="How_is_this_site_arranged_"> How is this site arranged? </a>

Our site runs the [TWiki](http://twiki.org) software and the GNU skin. The WebMenu on the left side holds references to "topics" and "webs" available in this wiki. Webs are a type of logical partitioning of content. Each web has a different color and a set of administrative functions that apply to it. TWiki webs are similar to "Chapters" in a book.

The Main and TWiki webs are for system use. The [[HurdGnuFansOrg]] web primarily contains information about the [[Main/TWikiUsers]]. The [[TWiki/WebHome]] web primarily contains documentation about TWiki. Futher details can be found in the [[TWikiColophon]].

Here are some more Wiki conventions and terminology. Each HTML page is called a topic. Each topic has a special "wiki name". [[TWiki/WikiWords]] are assumed to be topics in the current web unless preceded by the name of a web and a period.

For example, the traditional home page of this site is located at [[Hurd/WebHome]] since we started this site with only one web. Due to the success of the site we are in the process of moving and copying topics into webs based on project names. We hope this new arrangement will help in many ways.

## <a name="I_want_to_install_the_Hurd_on_my"> I want to install the Hurd on my system. Where do I start? </a>

First, decide how you want to install a Hurd system: CD-ROM, tarball or bochs system image. Then download, install and boot your new system. [[Hurd/InstallNotes]] is a good reference that points to other data on these methods that is included in several other topics.
