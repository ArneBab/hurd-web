## <a name="Welcome_to_http_hurd_gnufans_org"> </a> Welcome to <http://hurd.gnufans.org>!

This site focuses on providing a user updatable (hopefully the most current) information possible regarding the status and development of the GNU project's GNU operating system. There are many areas to comment on it's core component (the Hurd) and other very closely related but distinct projects. This is an all volunteer effort intended to supplement the official sites. If you see an error **please** fix it! It is a collaboration effort powered by TWiki software installed in May, 2002.

You must use the Grub Boot Loader (not Lilo) to boot a Debian GNU/Hurd system. A total of two gigabytes of unpartitioned disk space is more than enough. The best installation information is [avaiable here](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install).

## <a name="What_specifically_is_the_Hurd_"> What specifically is the Hurd? </a>

The [[Hurd/WebHome]] is the GNU replacement for UNIX and Linux "kernels." It is a collection of servers that run on top of the [[Mach/WebHome]] microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are today implemented by the Unix, Linux or other kernels. All operating systems (including Windows and Mac) perform these functions.

The [[Hurd/WebHome]] supplies the last piece needed for a complete [[GNU/WebHome]] operating system as originally conceived by Richard M Stallman (RMS) in 1983. The GNU vision drove the creation of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The name Hurd is also commonly used to refer to machines running the [[Distrib/WebHome]].

## <a name="What_s_the_current_status_of_the"> What's the current status of the Hurd? </a>

Even most developers do not use it as their primary day to day operating system yet. Functional systems are currently being distributed in CD-ROM, tarball and Bochs system image formats. Development systems are currently based on the Debian GNU/Hurd port ([[Distrib/WebHome]]).

Community resources for related projects focus around [[Hurd/WebHome]], [[Hurd/MailLists]] and [[Hurd/HurdIRC]].

An "official 1.0 release" has been a dream since 1983. Project resources are scarce, a more precise time estimate is not possible. The project welcomes assistance you can provide.

## <a name="Can_I_add_some_information_to_th"> Can I add some information to the pages here? </a>

Yes, this is encouraged. If you are not familiar with the TWiki collaboration tool (a Wiki type software implementation) and would like to contribute some content to the site, please visit [[TWiki/WelcomeGuest]]. Feel free to join in, but we do have some simple requests.

In an ideal Wiki everyone is equal and shares equal rights, liberties and responsibilities. Please respect the guidelines described in the %TWIKIWEB%.GoodStyle. Also try to match the "tone" of your topics and edits with the existing topics. If we all pull in the same direction the site will be more useful for everyone, especially for us. _We prefer that you create your own [[Main/TWikiUsers]] on the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiRegistration page when **contributing**. No account is necessary for **browsing**._ You may also use the [[Main/TWikiGuest]] account when commenting on topics.

## <a name="How_is_this_site_arranged_"> How is this site arranged? </a>

TWiki webs (very poor terminology) are similar to "Chapters" in a book. The WebMenu on the left side holds references to "topics" and "webs" available in this wiki. Each web has a different color.

The Main and TWiki webs are for system use. The [[HurdGnuFansOrg]] web primarily contains information about the [[Main/TWikiUsers]]. The [[TWiki/WebHome]] web primarily contains documentation about TWiki.

Here are some more Wiki conventions and terminology. Each HTML page is called a topic. Each topic has a special "wiki name". [[TWiki/WikiWords]] are assumed to be topics in the current web unless preceded by the name of a web and a period. For example the same link can also be written [[TWiki/WikiWords]].

Further information about this site and how it was created can be found in the [[TWikiColophon]]. Our site runs the [TWiki](http://twiki.org) software and the custom-developed GNU skin. There is a [[Main/HurdGnuFansOrgDiscuss]] for discussion about the contents of this particular page as well.
