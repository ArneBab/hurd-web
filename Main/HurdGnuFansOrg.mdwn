## <a name="Welcome_to_http_hurd_gnufans_org"> </a> Welcome to <http://hurd.gnufans.org>!

This site focuses on providing the most current information possible regarding the status and development of the GNU project's Hurd ([official site](http://hurd.gnu.org)) and other closely related projects. It is a volunteer effort intended to supplement the official sites and was started on May 11, 2002.

## <a name="What_is_the_Hurd_"> What is the Hurd? </a>

The [[Hurd/WebHome]] is the GNU replacement for the UNIX operating system. It consists of a set of servers running on top of a microkernel. When coupled with the [[Mach/WebHome]] microkernel the Hurd supplies the last piece needed for a complete [[GNU/WebHome]] operating system as originally conceived by Richard M Stallman (RMS). The GNU vision drove the creation of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

## <a name="What_s_the_current_status_of_the"> What's the current status of the Hurd? </a>

Even most developers do not use it as their primary day to day operating system yet. Functional systems are currently being distributed in CD-ROM, tarball and Bochs system image formats. Development systems are currently based on a Debian GNU/Hurd port ([[Distrib/WebHome]]).

An "official 1.0 release" is hoped for sometime in 2003. Since project resources are scarce, a more precise time estimate is not possible. The project welcomes any assistance you can provide.

## <a name="Can_I_add_some_information_to_th"> Can I add some information to the pages here? </a>

Yes, this is encouraged.

Feel free to join in, but please respect the guidelines described in the %TWIKIWEB%.GoodStyle and match the "tone" of your topics and edits with existing topics.

## <a name="How_is_this_site_arranged_"> How is this site arranged? </a>

Our site runs the [TWiki](http://twiki.org) software and the GNU skin. The WebMenu on the left side holds references to "topics" and "webs" available in this wiki. Webs are a type of logical partitioning of content. Each web has a different color and a set of administrative functions that apply to it. TWiki webs are similar to "Chapters" in a book.

The Main and TWiki webs are for system use. The [[Main/WebHome]] web primarily contains information about the [[Main/TWikiUsers]]. The [[TWiki/WebHome]] web primarily contains documentation about TWiki.

Each HTML page is called a topic. Each topic has a special "wiki name". Wiki names are assumed to be in the current web unless preceded by the name of a web and a period. For example, the traditional home page of this site is located at [[Hurd/WebHome]] since we started this site with only one web. Due to the success of the site we are in the process of moving and copying topics into webs based on project names. We hope this new arrangement will help in many ways.

A generic [WikiWikiWeb](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors), or simply Wiki, is _"a collaborative forum where people can share ideas and record any consensus reached on difficult issues, along with rebuttal. It changes as people come and go, as experience develops, and as opinions change." The TWiki software is an enhanced descendent of the original WikiWikiWeb._

First, decide how you want to install a Hurd system: CD-ROM, tarball or bochs system image. Then download, install and boot your new system.

## <a name="I_want_to_help_assist_in_bringin"> I want to help assist in bringing about a 1.0 Hurd release. Where do I start? </a>

The mail lists and IRC's #hurd are the two primary discussion forums. There have also been several conferences that served as meeting points for developers. Of course this website provides some valuable summaries and additions as well.
