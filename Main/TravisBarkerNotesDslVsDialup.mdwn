**DSL vs Dialup**

## <a name="Digital_Subscriber_Line_DSL"> </a> Digital Subscriber Line - DSL

* Faster
* More Expensive
* Always On
* Can use phone line while online
* Different Equipment

**THEY BOTH USE PHONE LINE**

* 2 types of dsl
  * ADSL ASYNCRONOUS OR ASYMETRIC 1.5 TO 9MB DOWN 16-640 KB UP
  * SDSL SYNCRONOUS OR SYMETRIC 3MB DOWN 3MB UP

What equipment is needed

* DSL / Cable Modem
* Ethernet adapter
* Category 5 cable (ethernet cable)
* RT-45
* USB universal Serial Buss
  * (can be used but _do not_ reccoment)

## <a name="IP_Addressing"> IP Addressing </a>

* 0.0.0.0 =&gt; 255.255.255.255
* 4,228,250,625

### <a name="Private_IP_Address_Ranges"> Private IP Address Ranges </a>

* X=0-255 192.168.x.x - used w/ Routers&amp; Configurable Modems
  * This range is the most typical private range used.
* 10.x.x.x - Used w/ routers or configurable Modems.
* 172.16.x.x - Used w/ routers. (this is a typical range used by businesses)

### <a name="Non_Routable_Range"> Non-Routable Range </a>

* 169-254.x.x - Non Routable IP Range telling you something is broken Created by Microsoft for troubleshooting purposes
* 127.x.x.x - Range reserved for local host (norton's, microsoft, etc.)

## <a name="Acronyms"> Acronyms </a>

* IANA - internet Assigned Numbers Authority
  * Distribute IP Address to backbone Co. ie AT&amp;T, Bell Co.

### <a name="Public_IP_Addressing"> Public IP Addressing </a>

* How to become an ISP

1) Contact SBC to obtain IP Addresses: 300 members 66.137.124.1 - 66.137.124.101 2) Distribut IP Addresses Gateway Address = IP Addresses of the DHCP Server (endpoint) DHCP - Dynamic host control protocol

----

10 contact SBC to obtain more ip addresses 68.124.138.1 - 68.124.138.151 2) Distribute IP addresses

* Static - Specified IP address that never changes

## <a name="Authentication_Processes"> Authentication Processes </a>

**MAC Addressing** \*MAC address- Physical address of any device that can carry an internet connection

* it authenticates through the modem or next piece of connecting equipment's MAC Address

PPOE - Point to point protocol (over the enternet) -requires a customer to logon w/user/password before reciving an ip address the only os w/ppoe built in XP&amp;MACX they install pppoe software or get a router or configurable modem.

Trouble shooting DSL / Cable

## <a name="1st_Step_of_Trouble_shooting_POW"> </a> 1st Step of Trouble shooting - POWERCYCLING

### <a name="take_down_order"> take down order </a>

* unplug modem from power supply
* unplug any connecting equipment from Power Supply (router, Switch, etc)
* SHUTDOWN (not restart) the pc

### <a name="bringing_up_order"> bringing up order </a>

* plugin the modem into power supply
* plug the connecting equipment into the power suply
* restart the PC

2nd Step of [[TroubleShooting]] -Light Status Modem

\*Power

* * on = good
  * off = bad

 1. verifty it is plugged in 2. check for power at the source (switch?)

* dsl/link/sync
  * on = good
  * off = bad

1. check connection between wall and modem phone line dsl + co-AX cable) 2. verify it worked previously nothing changed, (moved, jacks, storm) 3. verify all connecting information (PPPOE, MAC address, static)

* * Enet/USB/PC/Sync/Link
  * on = good
  * off = bad

 1.check connection between modem and pc ethernet usb 2. swithc cable ends crossover vs straight through 3. check the ethernet adapter

* Act/Activity/Data/(10/100) - TX/RX
  * on or flashing = good
  * off = bad

 1 this light has no bearing in your troubleshooting

* Test/Alarm/Standby
  * off = good
  * on = bad

1. this light must be off in orter to troubleshoot.

Where to find IP information - IP configuration LC start =&gt; LC run =&gt; tye commands or cmd =&gt; LC OK button =&gt; type "winipcfg" =&gt; press enter =&gt; chose NIC in dropdown

1.) Adapter Address = MAC address 2.) IP address - NIC 3.) Gateway Address - DHCP Server

* If there is **NO** NIC in the dropdown box
  * verify cust has startup disk or cab files (win\*.cab)
  * Rip and reinstall TCP/IP
* If it says Media Disconnectd or IP = 0.0.0.0
  * Not connected
  * verify lights on modem
  * verify wiring

 \* if they are reciving an IP address of 169.254.x.x

* they are set to DHCP, but not contacting DHCP Server

 - Its broken and try to release /renew ip address

## <a name="what_will_happen_next"> what will happen next </a>

1. will recieve IP Address

2."Unable to contact DHCP Server" Error

* try to release and renew again

3. "DHCP Server unavailable revewing IP address" - Error

* try to release and renew again

4. "No adapter in a state permissable to perform operation" Error

* configured to static
* check settings

5. "unable to perform operation" or " operation was attempted on something that is not a socket" Error \* winsock Error

* * email winsock fix
  * Send to shop

## <a name="if_you_are_unable_to_recieve_an_"> if you are unable to recieve an IP address </a>

* verify wiring
* verify account
* verify settings

## <a name="where_to_go_and_check_settings"> where to go and check settings </a>

* DLC My Comp &gt; dlc Control Panel &gt; DLC Network &gt;highlight TCP/IP =&gt; Ethernet Adapter - - LC Properties button
* IP addresses tab =&gt; Static - Specify an IP address Dynamic Obtain Automatic
* Gateway tab =&gt; Static - 1 gateway address entered Dynamic None entered
* DNS Tab - ISP Specific

PING packet internet Groper

Sonar for the internet

3 ways to tell if you are connected to the internet

1. ping outside address
2. thpe winipcfg =&gt; press enter =&gt; choose NIC in drop down box obtain ip address and gateway address (put in tracker notes0
3. type ping ipaddress press enter ie ping 192.168.1.100 ethernet adapter

* good response = 4 sent
* Bad response - 4 sent 0-3 recieved / 1-4 lost
  1. Check for a firewall =&gt; disable it and run ping again
  2. rip and reinstall TCP/IP =&gt; Run ping again
  3. check the ethernet adapter

1. type ping gatewayaddress =&gt; press enter (ie ping 192.168.1.1) DHCP Server Bad Response
  1. 1. ) check for a firewall =&gt; disable =&gt; run ping again
    2. ) Rip and reinstall TCP/IP =&gt; run ping again
    3. ) make sure network allows ping (shawneeling and madison)
    4. ) verify all connectings information (pppoe, &lt;MAC address,, Static)
    5. ) Broken - Sent ticket to network
2. type ping www.yahoo.com =&gt; press enter good response = connected

1. type ping yahoo's ip press enter (ie ping 216.109.118.76)
  * if you get a bad response on the domain name and good response on IP check DNS
  * after entering DNS if you still cant pull the site by domain or IP =&gt; winsock error - email or shop

Checking the NIC - Network Interface Controller

DLC My Comp =&gt; DLC Control Panel =&gt; DLC System =&gt; LC Device Manager Tab =&gt; LC (+) next to network adapters

If there is Red X

* Means the device has been disabled RC the device LC Enable.

 If there is Yellow!

* Means the PC recognizes the device but does not know how to use it
* Uninstall/Reinstall NIC - RC the device =&gt; LC Uninstall =&gt; LC OK =&gt; Reboot PC =&gt; Follow hardware wizard
* to uninstall they must have drivers disk or it must be original to PC

if there is yellow or no network adapters (check other devices for PCI Adapter)

* means PC has no idea what device is or how to use it
* uninstall reinstall NIC
* Same as Above
