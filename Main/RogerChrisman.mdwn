* Comment: My test TWiki is at TEFLW.net. I want to use TWiki engine on TEFLChina.org. [[GnuHurdSkin]] looks like it may have some quality features to use in my site skin. My site architecture goals I strive for simplicity for my users. Thus: - Simple URLs. - Less use of TWiki name. It is not our site's topic. - Automatic creation of top level directory pages under top level site sections defined by [[SiteAdmin]]. - less TWiki termanology -- 'Web' means WWW to my members -- why conflate terms? I write 'site sections' instead of 'TWiki Webs'. Partly becaues my site is more sectionally organized than a caotic wed. Summary: - topical. - simple to navigate. - ease of colaborative content creation. - (in that order) Roger :-\}
