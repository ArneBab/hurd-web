I am now finding a problem with using the [[HurdGnuFansOrg]] as the exact same page as the <http://hurd.gnufans.org/> "index.html" HTML page. There is no "directory" for the Main web and only links in the menu at left to get to all the other user's pages.

There's also another problem. I would like to move many of the "Community" pages listed near the top of the [[Hurd/WebHome]] page to the Main web, but without an index page NOBODY will find them. I will hold off doing this until we can find some reasonable solution.

In other words, the global main index page for the domain and the [[HurdGnuFansOrg]] page have different functions that are both necessary. It took me awhile to figure out this is why I didn't like this idea. Sorry it took so long.

Any suggestions?
