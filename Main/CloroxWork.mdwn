Here's a place for my own personal discussion to talk about my new job. Please add your comments (congratulations?) :-) in "blog form" and/or [[TWiki/GoodStyle]] form below. I'll add more to this page when I have more time.

I can't believe it. They let me go on my second day of work!

What? <br /> What happened?

That is truly the worst job story I've ever heard. I'm sorry!
