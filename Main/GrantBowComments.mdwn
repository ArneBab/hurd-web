If you want to chat with me via the TWiki site, this is the place to do it. I feel better about doing it here since my user information can't be changed by someone unauthorized. Am I a bit paranoid about it? Maybe so, but I do have trust issues when it comes to computer security. I've been on both sides of the fence here. ;-)
