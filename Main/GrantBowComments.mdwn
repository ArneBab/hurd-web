If you want to chat with me via the TWiki site, this is the place to do it. I feel better about doing it here since my user information can't be changed by someone unauthorized. Am I a bit paranoid about it? Maybe so, but I do have trust issues when it comes to computer security. I've been on both sides of the fence here. ;-)

From IRC:

* I just got your email about the CVS. I haven't done that yet but I will. I had a one hour conversation with Peter about TWiki yesterday and have been trying to help him get the release out the door. I've been drafted (by choice)!

The project page for twiki-skins at Savannah should have all you need (wrt CVS et. al.).

Aha, a new TWiki release! Great, we've been eagerly expecting it. Thanks for helping out with it, Grant! Time for me to try and squeeze in that [[TWiki/GnuSkin]] release I've been promising.

Personally I'm currently preparing for a Hurd demo I'm doing with FSFeurope at [NordU/USENIX](http://www.nordu.org/NordU2003/) 2003 here in V�ster�s in Febuary.
