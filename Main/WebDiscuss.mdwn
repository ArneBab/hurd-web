Good work on the front page, Grant!

I've done some minor cosmetic changes only. See the [[SCRIPTURLrdiffSCRIPTSUFFIXMainHurdGnuFansOrgrev1129rev2128]] for details.

You did all the hard work in this area! I'm glad we have a Main.WebHome to play with again. I like the idea of moving the main page to it's own topic. I'm going to rework the WebHome as I have done all the other similar pages. This is great, thanks!
