Just like a book, this topic is designed to help describe the tools used to create this website and what methods were used to give it it's look and feel.

We use a particular implementation (or clone) of Wiki software called [TWiki](http://twiki.org).

A generic [WikiWikiWeb](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors), or simply Wiki, is _"a collaborative forum where people can share ideas and record any consensus reached on difficult issues, along with rebuttal. It changes as people come and go, as experience develops, and as opinions change." The TWiki software is an enhanced descendent of the original WikiWikiWeb._

We use the [GNU Skin](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/GnuSkin) created by our own [[Main/JoachimNilsson]].
