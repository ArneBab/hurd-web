Just like a book, this topic is designed to help describe the tools used to create this website and what methods were used to give it it's look and feel.

We use a particular implementation (or clone) of Wiki software called [TWiki](http://twiki.org).

A generic [WikiWikiWeb](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors), or simply Wiki, is _"a collaborative forum where people can share ideas and record any consensus reached on difficult issues, along with rebuttal. It changes as people come and go, as experience develops, and as opinions change." The TWiki software is an enhanced descendent of the original WikiWikiWeb._

We use the [GNU Skin](http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/GnuSkin) created by our own [[Main/JoachimNilsson]].

This site begain in May, 2002 as one TWiki web: [[Hurd]]. This WebHome page was used as the front page of the whole site. We grew this site and added more TWiki webs by December, 2002. Due to the success of the site we are in the process of more completely addressing copyright issues. More people are adding content. Our [Webalizer](http://hurd.gnufans.org/webalizer/) shows our overall site visits over the past 12 months.

We hope the new arrangement using multiple TWiki webs will help newcomers and old timers alike. Your Feedback is encouraged. Each Web has a WebDiscuss topic. ([[Hurd/WebDiscuss]], [[Distrib/WebDiscuss]], [[Mach/WebDiscuss]], [[GNU/WebDiscuss]], [[Mig/WebDiscuss]], [[Main/WebDiscuss]] and [[TWiki/WebDiscuss]]) The global feedback page is [[TWiki/TWikiDiscuss]]. A feedback topic specifically for the front page is available at [[Main/HurdGnuFansOrgDiscuss]].

On 2007-08-12 [[Thomas_Schwinge|tschwinge]] finished the conversion of the
TWiki content to ikiwiki.  On [[AboutTheTWikiToIkiwikiConversion]] you can read
a bit about that.
