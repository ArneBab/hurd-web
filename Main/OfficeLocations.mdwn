The OfficeLocations topic has a list of all your offices.

* [[SanJoseOffice]]
* [[LondonOffice]]
* [[TokyoOffice]]

(This is an example of corporate intranet use and is for demonstration purposes only: %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiRegistration asks for an office location. To add/remove an office edit the [[OfficeLocations]] topic and the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiRegistration topic)
