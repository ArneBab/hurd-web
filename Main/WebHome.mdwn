Sporadic efforts by numerous individuals have been made to keep the information in this wiki current. The hope that the primary development team would make this a canonical source has not been fulfilled. While some of the information and links here are still valid, unfortunately much is not.

**<font> %TWIKIWEB%.WelcomeGuest: </font>** Wiki is a web-based collaboration tool, document management tool and knowledge base tool. We have used [TWiki](http://TWiki.org) to create our site, <http://hurd.gnufans.org>. You can edit any wiki page, and please, use [[TWiki/GoodStyle]].

For tests and playing around we recommend the [[Test/WebHome]].

Please start where we %TWIKIWEB%.WelcomeGuests; it is a topic explaining what this is, how to get around, and how you get involved. Frequent visitors may want to go straight to one of the collaboration areas on the menu to the left side, or another of the useful %TWIKIWEB%.StartingPoints.
