### <a name="Personal"> Personal </a>

Hello, this is the page of [Joachim Nilsson](http://vmlinux.org/joachim/). I'm a computer geek soon to turn "Dad" with a lot of diverse interests. This wiki page displays some of my interests.

I am employed as a embedded systems consultant for the Swedish company Aktiebolaget �ngpannef�reningen in V�ster�s. Roughly, "The Incorporated Steamboiling Association". As you might have guessed it's a very old consultant firm from 1896. Today they cover almost all engineering disciplines. See more on <http://www.af-world.com>

### <a name="Hardcore_stuff"> Hardcore stuff </a>

I'm a bit involved in the GNU operating system, the Hurd. Having done some contractual work earlier on both on the [[VxWorks]] Wind kernel, Linux and eCos I got interested in micro kernels. Being a free software enthusiast I am now focusing my energy on GNU. More specifically, GNUmach 2.0, a.k.a. OSKit-Mach.

Currently I work on updating the Linux drivers in the OSKit from 2.2.12 to 2.2.21. See progress at:

<http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view/Hurd/JoachimNilssonHurdPage>

One of my goals is to get my SMP machine at home booting the Hurd. This is now impossible due to the ATA-100 controller which does not have support in Mach.

I am the local TWiki admin guy. When I volonteered to run the Hurd wiki web on <http://vmlinux.org> I decided to create a suitable skin for it. The result is the [[TWiki/GnuSkinPlugin]]. See it in action on the [[Hurd/WebHome]] web. Other stuff I've done, and still working on, is this. The [[TWiki/TigerSkinPlugin]]. Actually, I'm only updating it and fixing it so it'll work with Mozilla more nicely -- lot of work remains since it's a complex skin.
