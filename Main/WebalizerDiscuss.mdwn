I see spikes in September, December and this month so far. But September was alot of active people (# sites was actually down). December lots of bandwidth and visits but pages was flat - casual lookers. I'm sure I'm presonally having an effect in the current month already. :-) I've also talked on #hurd again a bit and gotten the pisg IRC statistics going for the folks there.

It has been quite interesting to see how the notification emails sometimes increase as well. For quite some time it was dead silent but now I get like ten emails a day.

When it rains it pours, I guess. :)
