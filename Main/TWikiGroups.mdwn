These groups can be used to define fine grained %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiAccessControl in %WIKITOOLNAME%:

* [[TWikiAdminGroup]]
* [[EngineeringGroup]]
* [[SupportGroup]]
*

Add your groups to this list and define new group topics similar to existing ones. Group topics **_must_** end in `...Group.`

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Think twice before restricting write access to a web or a topic, because an open system where everybody can contribute is the essence of the %TWIKIWEB%.WikiCulture. Experience shows that unrestricted write access works very well because:

* There is enough peer pressure to post only conform content.
* Content does not get lost because topics are under revision control.
* A topic revision can be undone by a member of the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup in case needed.

**_Related topics:_** %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiAccessControl, [[WebPreferences]], [[TWikiUsers]], %TWIKIWEB%.WikiCulture.
