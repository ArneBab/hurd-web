This topic is for discussion of the HTML page that should be used as a "home" page instead of the Hurd Web. We've expanded the scope of what we covered and created some new webs we'll be migrating data toward. It's a process. However even the main twiki.org site has a [standard HTML page](http://twiki.org) that orients new people to understanding the web structure of the twiki.org web site and gives basic intro summary. I would like to keep it brief and demonstrate the real meat of the various webs including some kind of contextual introduction. This is needed before browsing any twiki site with multiple "webs" which is a twiki specific concept.

Here is my proposal. Almost same "look" as hurd.gnu.org, and almost same logo but with an added "-Wiki" in another fontset. (I looked at the MetaFont code for the current Hurd logo and realised it would take me forever to construct the wiki part similarily.) Take a look at [[Main/WebHome]] for a good idea of how this (below) would look in practise, including both text and the above mentioned logo.

A very **neat** thing is a [[ATTACHURLhurdwikigencgi]] that [JAkov](http://gnufans.org/jakov/) and I did a while back. It can extract the HTML out of a topic so that it can easily be inserted into an ordinary web page using simple SSI.

Therefore I propose that this introductory page on <http://hurd.gnufans.org> holds the same information as the page on <http://hurd.gnufans.org/bin/view>, which is the Main web (a.k.a. "Users" web). This has several advantages:

1. Links in TWiki often point to the Main web for reference. This way people get to the "Home" of the Wiki and not to a bisarre page about TWiki, which they don't want to know anything about.
2. Having the same content on the front page and in the Main TWiki web provides a smooth transition for a beginner - at least he/she recognizes the content even if the interface suddenly changed.
3. The Hurd wiki administrators (currently, [[Main/GrantBow]] and [[Main/JoachimNilsson]]) can be set to be the only ones allowed to change the [[Main/WebHome]] topic.
4. We can move all administrative stuff like Registration and similar to the Main web. Freeing the Hurd web from this overhead.

The actual proposed page (using the python script and content from [[Main/WebHome]]) can be previewed at <http://hurd.gnufans.org/joachim/hurd/gnufans/>

Welcome to [the Hurd](http://hurd.gnu.org) Wiki. It is a web based collaboration for collecting useful information about the [the GNU system](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#TheGNUsystem). Anyone is free join in and contribute. [[TWiki/TWikiRegistration]] today and get a free GNU system from your local FTP mirror as a bonus!

A [Wiki](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors) "is a collaborative forum where people can share ideas and record any consensus reached on difficult issues, along with rebuttal. It changes as people come and go, as experience develops, and as opinions change." This Wiki, however, of course focuses on providing the most current information possible regarding the status and development of the Hurd.

We here present you with the currently available "sections" in this wiki:

----

<dl>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">GNU/Hurd</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Concerns everything directly related to the Hurd (it was the first section). </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">GNUmach</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONMach/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Topics on the GNU Mach microkernel, and the OSKit based Mach (GNUmach 2). </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">MiÂ G</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONMig/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Thin section on the Mach interface generator, only for developers. </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">GNU</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONGNU/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Holds all GNUish related information regarding the Hurd. </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Distrib</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONDistrib/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Thus far only a work in progress. Debian GNU/Hurd distribution related information goes here. </dd>

Again, welcome to the world of Free Software and the GNU Operating System, the Hurd.

As always I do too much and try too hard. My old English teacher though (who actually was from Britain) gave me one really good advice. He said: "Simplify, simplify, simplify!". I have used that throughout most of what I do, but for brainstorming in a Wiki it's really no good if I don't let other people first see what and how I think. :-)

So, let the refactoring begin!
