This topic is for discussion of the HTML page that should be used as a "home" page instead of the Hurd Web. We've expanded the scope of what we covered and created some new webs we'll be migrating data toward. It's a process. However even the main twiki.org page has a standard HTML page that orients new people to even understanding the web structure of the twiki.org web site and gives basic intro summary. I would like to keep it brief and have the real meat in the various webs but some kind of contextual introduction is needed before browsing a twiki site with multiple "webs" which is a twiki specific concept.
