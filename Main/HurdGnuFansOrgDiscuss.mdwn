This topic is for discussion of the HTML page that should be used as a "home" page instead of the Hurd Web. We've expanded the scope of what we covered and created some new webs we'll be migrating data toward. It's a process. However even the main twiki.org site has a [standard HTML page](http://twiki.org) that orients new people to understanding the web structure of the twiki.org web site and gives basic intro summary. I would like to keep it brief and demonstrate the real meat of the various webs including some kind of contextual introduction. This is needed before browsing any twiki site with multiple "webs" which is a twiki specific concept.

How about something like this (refactor as usual):

[Almost same "look" as hurd.gnu.org, and almost same logo but with an added "-Wiki" in another fontset. (I looked at the MetaFont code for the current Hurd logo and realised it would take me forever to construct the wiki part similarily.)]

The webs we can call "sections" and the text on the page (no more than a screenful) could be something like this:

----

Welcome to [the Hurd](http://hurd.gnu.org) Wiki. It is a web based collaboration for collecting useful information about the [the GNU system](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#TheGNUsystem). Anyone is free join in and contribute. [[TWiki/TWikiRegistration]] today and get a free GNU system from your local FTP mirror as a bonus!

A [Wiki](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors) "is a collaborative forum where people can share ideas and record any consensus reached on difficult issues, along with rebuttal. It changes as people come and go, as experience develops, and as opinions change." This Wiki, however, of course focuses on providing the most current information possible regarding the status and development of the Hurd.

We here present you with the currently available "sections" in this wiki:

----

<dl>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">GNU/Hurd</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONHurd/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Concerns everything directly related to the Hurd (it was the first section). </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">GNUmach</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONMach/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Topics on the GNU Mach microkernel, and the OSKit based Mach (GNUmach 2). </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">MiÂ G</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONMig/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Thin section on the Mach interface generator, only for developers. </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">GNU</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONGNU/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Holds all GNUish related information regarding the Hurd. </dd>
  <dt><span style="background:"><font color="">Distrib</font></span><a href="http://LOCATIONDistrib/WebHome">?</a></dt>
  <dd> Thus far only a work in progress. Debian GNU/Hurd distribution related information goes here. </dd>
</dl>

Again, welcome to the world of Free Software and the GNU Operating System, the Hurd.

As always I do too much and try too hard. My old English teacher though (who actually was from Britain) gave me one really good advice. He said: "Simplify, simplify, simplify!". I have used that throughout most of what I do, but for brainstorming in a Wiki it's really no good if I don't let other people first see what and how I think. :-)

So, let the refactoring begin!
