This topic is for discussion of the HTML page that should be used as a "home" page instead of the Hurd Web. We've expanded the scope of what we covered and created some new webs we'll be migrating data toward. It's a process. However even the main twiki.org site has a [standard HTML page](http://twiki.org) that orients new people to understanding the web structure of the twiki.org web site and gives basic intro summary. I would like to keep it brief and demonstrate the real meat of the various webs including some kind of contextual introduction. This is needed before browsing any twiki site with multiple "webs" which is a twiki specific concept.
