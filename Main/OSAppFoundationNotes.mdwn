I just added <http://www.osafoundation.com> to my <http://www.grantbow.com/groupware.html> page. Fascinating stuff.

I emailed their [TWiki](http://wiki.osafoundation.com) webmaster because they didn't set up their registration correctly to allow me to enter or give me my password when I registered. We could teach them a thing or two perhaps... Until I get my username straightened out over there I'll make notes on this page.

This might be a tremendous win in itself if positioned and integrated well with the other parts. The similarities to the OHS Hyperscope are very telling. I wonder how much exposure he's had to Doug's <http://www.boostrap.org> ideas.
