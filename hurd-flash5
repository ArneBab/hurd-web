Subject: New milestone acheived by the GNU Hurd
X-Tom-Swiftie: "I can't get this fire started," Tom said woodenly.


I have just successfully compiled and run a null C program on the
Hurd.  This is using GCC native as one would normally use GCC.

Sadly, it took quite a while (too long, in fact) to read the large
archives that make up the GNU C library, but I think I know where the
substantial inefficiency is.

Once that is done, I would be happy to label this a "self-hosting
system".  But not just yet.

The last bug preventing this was an error in dealing with files over
about 8 M; this came about because in order to link a program one
needed the GNU C library, which is over 9M when symbols are included.
