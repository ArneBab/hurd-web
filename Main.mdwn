<p> There is an expanding community of people developing and running test Debian GNU/Hurd machines. Many have already registered on this TWiki system and contributed information directly to this site. We have also linked to all the relevant data you can find on other sites. </p>
<p> The two key resources most often used for communication are the Debian and GNU [[Hurd/MailLists]], as well as the [[Hurd/HurdIRC]]. </p>
