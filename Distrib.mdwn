<a href="http://www.gnuab.org/qui-som" target="_top">GNUAB</a> has some images and packages available at <a href="http://ftp.gnuab.org" target="_top">http://ftp.gnuab.org</a> for the unreleased (not unstable) Debian distro

## <a href="http://hurd.rustedhalo.net/" target="_top">Gentoo-Hurd</a></dt>

Unofficial port to Gentoo &amp;amp; the portage system. It was <a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=41939&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" target="_top">announced</a> March 17, 2003 in the Gentoo forums. There's a #gentoo-irc channel similar to [[Hurd/HurdIRC]]. At present (May 2005), there's no activity and Eric Olinger has not the time to maintain this distri.

## <a href="http://bee.es.gnu.org/" target="_top">Bee GNU/Hurd</a></dt>

Castellano distribution, pkgsrc package based. [[BochsEmulator]] image available too. They have their own <a href="http://es.gnu.org/cgi-bin/beewiki.pl?Wiki_Bee_GNU" target="_top">wiki</a> and a <a href="http://bee.es.gnu.org/?p=mail&amp;l=en" target="_top">mail list</a> (no archive).

## [[GnuOS]]

Distribution is in discussion &amp;amp; pre-planning phase


# Issues

<dt>[[SoftwareLicensing]]</dt>
<dd> The copyright and license information for software that is distributed with the Hurd software is important. Debian has it's DFSG guidelines. Other distributions will need to address these same issues. </dd>

## <a name="Installation"> Installation </a>

<dl>
  <dt> Install Instructions</dt>
  <dd> Currently, <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install" target="_top">Debian's installation instructions</a> are the most up-to-date. [[Hurd/InstallNotes]] is an errata companion document with more helpful hints that have not yet been incorporated. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[CrossInstall]]</dt>
  <dd> Another way to install a system. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt> Release Information</dt>
  <dd> About the latest CD release. Includes errata, known bugs and fixes. See [[CDNotesHome]] and [[TarballNotesHome]] for summaries </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[GrubNotes]]</dt>
  <dd> A quick reference and explanation. There's also a topic for the new [[GrubConf]]. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[InstallTips]]</dt>
  <dd> Info on how to install without a cd drive or linux installed as well as a few tips. </dd>
</dl>

Another installation method is using an emulated environment. The [[BochsEmulator]] was originally the recommended virtual machine solution, however most have switched over to QEMU, as it runs faster.

* [[HurdOnQEMU]] - A guide on how to use QEMU to run the hurd.
* [[BochsFAQ]] - Common questions you should read.
* [[VmWare]] - Why using it is discouraged.

<dl>
  <dt> Debian Installer</dt>
  <dd> Work has been started by James Morrison and Glenn <nop>McGrath to [[PortDebootstrap]]. There is also a [[NewDebianInstaller]]. Why should Hurd folks care? It's important because this is the next generation installer that is intended to be used by all ports when Sarge is released. </nop></dd>

# Using

[[DebianAfterInstall]] instructions are a must-read to prepare an usable system.

[[PackageTroubleshooting]] reports known bugs, quirks and workarounds about getting applications to work (if possible).

# For Developers

<dl>
  <dt>[[SavannahProjects]]</dt>
  <dd> Savannah is a CVS &amp;amp; Bug system evolved from a free version of the code that powers <a href="http://sf.net" target="_top">sourceforge.net</a>. It has forked and been slightly modified for use by FSF, GNU and non-GNU projects. Actual Development takes place here. There is also a <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/people/?group=hurd" target="_top">help wanted</a> list. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[PortingIssues]] FAQ</dt>
  <dd> What does it take to move a piece of Debian packaged software to the GNU/Hurd port? </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[BuildingTheHurd]]</dt>
  <dd> A summary by the Gentoo folks, thanks <a href="http://cvs.gentoo.org/~avenj/" target="_top">Jon Portnoy</a> - <a href="mailto:avenj@gentooNOSPAM.org">avenj@gentooNOSPAM.org</a></dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt> Debain Infrastructure</dt>
  <dd> Testing is critical in helping the development effort. Bugs (defect reports) can be filed against the Debian software package in which they are found. [[BtsFiling]] tells how to file a Debian bug report. [[DebianPackages]] has some information about how Debian splits the software into packages and some references. There is a buildd autobuilder compiling the Debian Sid archive software for the GNU/Hurd port. [[BuilddStatus]] includes information on the buildd &amp;amp; turtle efforts. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://hurd.she.kicks-ass.org:8084/uninstallable/" target="_top">Uninstallable packages</a></dt>
  <dd> Many packages depend on these uninstallable packages. So building one of them will allow other to be build too. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt> Technical References</dt>
  <dd> There are many standards and documents that might be applicable for those interested in developing software. </dd>
</dl>

* GNU [Coding Standards](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html)
* [[TestSuites]] - Posix, Perl, results feedback, etc.
* [docs and papers](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/docs.html)
* [[SystemAPILimits]]
* [[Hurd/HurdSpecificGlibcApi]]

<dl>
  <dt> Debian <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/" target="_top">Developer's Corner</a></dt>
  <dd> The following references are provided as a starting point for those interested in helping to package software for Debian GNU/Hurd and Debian GNU/Linux. </dd>
</dl>

* [Policy Manual](http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/)
* Developer's [Reference](http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/)
* New Maintainers [Guide](http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/)

<dl>
  <dt> Debian Todo</dt>
  <dd> Packages needing attention. A possible use of this site could be to help track similar needs via [[HurdWnpp]]. This is not yet implemented. </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[GnuDistributionRumors]]</dt>
  <dd> There are some discussions and several rumors circulating about creating a completely new distribution, not using a Debian architecture. </dd>
</dl>

# Misc.

<dl>
  <dt> Why a separate section of the website for this?</dt>
  <dd> There are fundamentally different issues about distributions compared with coding. Distributions are concerned with final default configurations of packaged software and system integration as they use many software packages and help give users a sense of using an OS "product." </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[WhyDebian]]</dt>
  <dd> A one page document focused on Debian aimed at users to answer their question "Why Debian?" </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>[[DebianProductSheet]]</dt>
  <dd> Technical description of Debian aimed at those interested in Debian. </dd>
