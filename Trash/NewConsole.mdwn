Here's a June [status report](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-June/009437.html)

In September there was a [request for testers](http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hurd/2002-September/010459.html). There's been quite a bit of discussion on <bug-hurd@gnuNOSPAM.org> about updates, test results and changes.
