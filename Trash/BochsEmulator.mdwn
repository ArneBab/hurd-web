[Bochs](http://bochs.sf.net) is so cool (btw there's a [Debian package](http://packages.debian.org/bochs)). It's currently the best alternative to run GNU on it (which is not much to say, but hey at least it boots).

Note that Bochs is quite slow and installing GNU in it will probably take you a few days. I've put a disk image for [download](http://khazad.dyndns.org/gnu/bochs/) so you can save that time.

WARNING!! THIS IMAGE IS BROKEN AND HAS BIG USABILITY PROBLEMS! Don't try it if you expect a complete usable system to learn about the Hurd!

It's not ready for general use and evaluation, so PLEASE DO NOT LINK TO THE IMAGE LOCATION OR DISTRIBUTE IT. Thanks.

On the other hand, if you want to help stabilising it have a look at the [PROBLEMS](http://khazad.dyndns.org/gnu/bochs/PROBLEMS) file, and mail the lists with any useful information you can come up with.
