We happen to have developers in Australia, Europe, Canada and the US so we have most time zones covered most of the time. Most of the logs are [kept here](http://web.walfield.org/~hird/) and collected by the Deride bot ([source code](http://ftp.walfield.org/pub/people/neal/deride/)).

_and we happen to have [[Hurd/HurdIRC]] already :)_

Oh, oops, sorry Michael, my mistake. We should refactor these pages together. I'm feeling a growing desire to refactor all kinds of stuff to help direct the inevitable growth of pages.
