Potential places to move Hurd Twiki to in order of preference:

* other
* savannah.gnu.org
* gnu.org

--

I favor removing gnu.org from the above list. There are copyright issues that are technically impossible to address in the way that RMS wants copyright assigned to all content hosted on gnu.org. While we probably could bend over backwards to accomodate it, fundamentally I think that this and other potential problems are not worth the effort of making this Hurd Twiki an official part of the GNU project.

Technically I think that savannah.gnu.org might be possible but I will defer to others for a decision from this perspective. Assuming it's possible, I think we may have similar problems as above.

I favor looking for another solution, an "other".
