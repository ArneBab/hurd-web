[[!meta title="domU console"]]

To avoid any complications with people trying to use the same console at the
same time, please use this command for attaching to a domU's console:

    $ sudo screen -DRRS xen-console-[domU] xm console [domU]

Otherwise, if one attaches to the same console twice, the second instance will
in fact forward input to the domU (possibly infering with what the person is
doing on the first instance), but the output won't be sent back to the second
instance.

After having typed this once, Bash's `reverse-search-history` (`C-r`), followed
by typing in `console-flubber`, for example, will be enough to get access to
that machine's console.

/!\ TODO: How does one get the environment variables `COLUMNS` and `LINES` set
properly when using `xm console`?  This is relevant for everything using
`(n)curses` -- for interactive console applications.
