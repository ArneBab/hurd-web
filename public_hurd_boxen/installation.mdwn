This page documents how installation of some new machines is being done.


# [[zenhost]]

For those on [[zenhost]], we use
*[install_crosshurd](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/incubator.git/log/?h=install_crosshurd)*.

Another option might be switching to <http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/>
or a equivalent system.

Steps for *install_crosshurd*:

  * Enable loggin with screen (`C-a H`).

  * \# lvcreate ...

  * machines/[MACHINE]

  * \# MACHINE=[MACHINE] TARGET=/dev/zenhost/[MACHINE]-root ./install_crosshurd

  * \# sudo umount /tmp/*/target

  * /etc/xen/[MACHINE]

  * \# xm create -c [MACHINE]

      * \# /install

          * TODO

                Unpacking debconf (from .../debconf_1.5.28_all.deb) ...

                Unpacking bash (from .../bash_4.1-3_hurd-i386.deb) ...
                The bash upgrade discovered that your /bin/sh link points to dash.
                As bash for Debian is destined to provide a working /bin/sh (pointing to
                /bin/bash) your link will be overwritten by a default link.

                If you don't want further upgrades to overwrite your customization, please
                read /usr/share/doc/bash/README.Debian.gz for a more permanent solution.

            That file doesn't say anything about it.

                Configuring libpam-runtime
                --------------------------

                Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) determine how authentication,
                authorization, and password changing are handled on the system, as well as
                allowing configuration of additional actions to take when starting user
                sessions.

                Some PAM module packages provide profiles that can be used to automatically
                adjust the behavior of all PAM-using applications on the system.  Please
                indicate which of these behaviors you wish to enable.

                  1. Unix authentication

                (Enter the items you want to select, separated by spaces.)

                PAM profiles to enable:  

          * if it's a Xen domU:

                # sudo apt-get --purge install libc0.3-xen libc0.3-i686-

      * As needed:

            # mkfs.ext2 -I 128 -b 4096 /dev/hd2 # TAKE CARE!
            # settrans /media/data /hurd/ext2fs /dev/hd2
            # mkdir /media/data/home
            # rmdir /home && ln -s media/data/home /

            # mkfs.ext2 -I 128 -b 4096 /dev/hd3 # TAKE CARE!
            # settrans /media/var /hurd/ext2fs /dev/hd3
            # mv /var /media/var/
            # ln -s media/var/var /

      * If needed: restore (parts of) some files

          * /etc/{passwd,shadow,group,gshadow}

              * \# adduser ... sudo

              * \# passwd root

          * (`mkdir /etc/ssh`), restore `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*key*`

      * \# syncfs -s && halt

  * \# xm create -c [MACHINE]

      * \# /install_packages

  * Until [[service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663/screen]] is fixed:

      * Install `flubber:~tschwinge/screen_4.0.3-11_hurd-i386.deb` instead.

          * \# printf 'screen\thold\n' | dpkg --set-selections

  * add line to zenhost's `/etc/hosts`

  * system-specific:

      * [[flubber]]
      * [[snubber]]


# [[darnassus]]
