# Branches

Members of the Hurd Savannah group,
<http://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist.php?group=hurd>, are allowed to
create branches without formal permission...

* named *SAVANNAH_LOGIN-WHATEVER-branch* for general-purpose branches, or

* named *BASE_BRANCH-WHATEVER-branch* for topic-branches basing on
    *BASE_BRANCH*.

*WHATEVER* shall be a suitable tag.

Examples:

* GNU Mach

    * *gnumach-1-branch-Xen-branch*
    * *gnumach-1-branch-gdb-branch*

* GNU Hurd

    * *miles-orphaned-changes*
    * *hammy-libchannel-branch*
    * *mmenal-soc2006-nfs-branch*

Also, create helper tags for merging mainline changes into your branches.

Examples:

* GNU Mach

    * *gnumach-1-branch-Xen-branch*: *gnumach-1-branch-Xen-branch-merge_helper*
    * *gnumach-1-branch-gdb-branch*: *gnumach-1-branch-gdb-branch-merge_helper*

* GNU Hurd

    * *hammy-libchannel-branch*: *hammy-libchannel-branch-base*
    * *mmenal-soc2006-nfs-branch*: *mmenal-soc2006-nfs-branch-base*

## Merging

Merging between CVS branches is not trivial.  Unless you really know what
you're doing, please talk to [[Thomas_Schwinge|tschwinge]] or
[[Samuel_Thibault|samuelthibault]], to avoid cluttering the repositories
unintendedly.

# Tags

Equivalent rules apply.

# Behavior

## ... on your branches

Most branches are to be eventually be merged back into the mainline branch.  To
faciliate (and also to help other contributors) we'd like you to write a short
summary log in a top-level (or wherever else appropriate) `ChangeLog.WHATEVER`
file.

Examples:

* GNU Mach

    * *gnumach-1-branch-Xen-branch*: `ChangeLog.Xen`
    * *gnumach-1-branch-gdb-branch-merge_helper*: `ChangeLog.gdb`

* GNU Hurd

    * *hammy-libchannel-branch-base*: `channelio/ChangeLog`, `libchannel/ChangeLog`
    * *mmenal-soc2006-nfs-branch-base*: `nfs/ChangeLog`

This need not be a full-fledged [GNU-style *ChangeLog*
file](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html).  E.g.,
don't waste time writing *ChangeLog* entries for debugging stuff that will be
removed again before merging back into mainline.  But please do write
something.  Short notes.

## ... in general

Try to not introduce spurious, unneeded changes, e.g., whitespace changes.

Adhere to the already-used coding conventions.  These are usually the [GNU
Coding Standards](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/) for stuff
written by ourselves, including new files, of course.

GNU Mach code is largely based on external code.  Don't GNU-ify it, as this
would make merging external patches unnecessarily difficult.
