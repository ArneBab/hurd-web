# Group membership

There is no need to be a formal member of the GNU Hurd Savannah group in order
to be able to contribute to the system.  In fact, if we added every single soul
that was interested in the Hurd to the Savannah group it'd probably have
exploded by now.  We have the policy of adding people as soon as they are
beginning to make substantial contributions.  Simply use the [[mailing_lists]]
for sending your contributions, for asking questions, and so on.

Have a look at the page for [[contributing]].  Also be sure to have a look at
the [[contributing/questionnaire]].

## List of members
