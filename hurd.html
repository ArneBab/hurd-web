<H3>NEWS</h3>
<p>November 3rd, 2000 - Integration has begun of the hurddocs.org site
HOWTO and WHATIS sections.  This will continue during the next little
while.<p>
<H3>What is the Hurd?</H3>

The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel. The
Hurd is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement
file systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features
that are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).
<P>
Currently, the Hurd runs on IA32 machines. The Hurd should, and probably
will, be ported to other hardware architectures or other microkernels in
the future.
<P>
The Hurd is part of the GNU, which is a complete free operating
system.  Since the Hurd is not in production use yet, the version of
GNU that is popular today is <A HREF="/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">
GNU/Linux</A>, which uses Linux as the kernel instead of the Hurd.

<H3>Advantages of the Hurd</H3>

The Hurd is not the most advanced kernel known to the planet
(yet), but it does have a number of enticing features:

<DL>

<DT><STRONG>it's free software</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the
<A HREF="/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
General Public License (GPL)</A>.</DD>

<DT><STRONG>it's compatible</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
The Hurd provides a familiar programming and user environment. For all
intents and purposes, the Hurd is a modern Unix-like kernel. The Hurd uses
the <A HREF="/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</A>,
whose development closely tracks standards such as ANSI/ISO,
BSD, POSIX, Single Unix, SVID, and X/Open.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>it's built to survive</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
Unlike other popular kernel software, the Hurd has an object-oriented structure
that allows it to evolve without compromising its design. This structure
will help the Hurd undergo major redesign and modifications without having
to be entirely rewritten.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>it's scalable</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
The Hurd implementation is aggressively multithreaded so that it runs efficiently
on both single processors and symmetric multiprocessors. The Hurd interfaces
are designed to allow transparent network clusters (<I>collectives</I>),
although this feature has not yet been implemented.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>it's extensible</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
The Hurd is an attractive platform for learning how to become a kernel
hacker or for implementing new ideas in kernel technology. Every part of
the system is designed to be modified and extended.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>it's stable</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
It is possible to develop and test new Hurd kernel components without rebooting
the machine (not even accidentally). Running your own kernel components
doesn't interfere with other users, and so no special system privileges
are required. The mechanism for kernel extensions is secure by design:
it is impossible to impose your changes upon other users unless they authorize
them or you are the system administrator.
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>it exists</STRONG></DT>

<DD>
The Hurd is real software that works Right Now. It is not a research
project or a proposal. You don't have to wait at all before you can start
using and developing it.
</DD>

</DL>


<H3>What the name ``Hurd'' means</H3>

According to Thomas Bushnell, BSG, the primary architect of the Hurd, ```Hurd' stands for `Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons'. And, then, `Hird'
stands for `Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth'. We have here, to my
knowledge, the first software to be named by a pair of mutually
recursive acronyms.''

<H3>Status of the project</H3>

The last official release of the Hurd-based GNU system was the 0.2
binary distribution of June 1997.  At the moment, the Hurd developers
and people from the Debian Project are assembling a new distribution
which will be known as version 0.3.  In parallel to that GNU/Linux
distribution, the upcoming Hurd-based GNU distribution is called <A
HREF="debian-gnu-hurd.html">Debian GNU/Hurd</A>.
<P>

The new GNU/Hurd distribution will use the Debian package management
system to ease installation and updating the system. This package
management system is the same one used in Debian GNU/Linux
distributions.

<P>

These efforts are ongoing, but the fundamental packages are ready and
quite stable. If you want to try out the Hurd, it is recommended that
you use the preliminary 0.3 version instead of the 0.2 version,
because the newer snapshots have many bugs fixed and are more stable.
