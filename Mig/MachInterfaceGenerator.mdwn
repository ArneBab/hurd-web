MiG is the Mach 3.0 interface generator, as maintained by the GNU Hurd developers for the GNU project.

The interface generator produces stub code from interface definition (.defs) files. The stub code makes it easy to implement and use Mach interfaces as remote procedure calls (RPC).

You need this tool to compile the GNU Mach and Hurd distributions, and to compile the GNU C library for the Hurd. Also, you will need it for other software in the GNU systems that uses Mach-based inter-process communication.
