## <a name="Introduction"> Introduction </a>

MIG is a program which generates remote procedure call (RPC) code for communication between client and server processes in a Mach based operating system. Since this Mig TWiki "web" is new and we are still migrating data to it, please look at the original [[Hurd/WebHome]] TWiki web as well.

Mach servers run as separate tasks and communicate with inter-process communication (IPC) messages. This IPC interface is language independant and faily complex. This is where MIG steps in. Mig is capable of generating the RPC code for the client-server communication.

GNU MIG is fully compatible with OSF MIG. The [official Mig](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mig.html) site is a page hosted on the official Hurd site. It also has it's own CVS module within the main Hurd CVS site.
