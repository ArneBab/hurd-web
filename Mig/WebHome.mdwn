Sporadic efforts by numerous individuals have been made to keep the information in this wiki current. The hope that the primary development team would make this a canonical source has not been fulfilled. While some of the information and links here are still valid, unfortunately much is not.

The [[MachInterfaceGenerator]] (MIG) is a program which generates inter-process communication (IPC) code. Specifically Mig generates remote procedure call (RPC) code for communication between client and server processes running on a Mach microkernel.

        <p> Mach servers run as separate tasks and communicate with RPC messages. The RPC interface is language independant and somewhat complex. MIG mitigates this complexity. </p>
        <p> GNU MIG is fully compatible with OSF MIG. The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mig.html" target="_top">official Mig</a> site is a page hosted on the official Hurd site. [[MigDocumentation]] is available. Mig also has it's own CVS module within the main Hurd CVS site. </p>
