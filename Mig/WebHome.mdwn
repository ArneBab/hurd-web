MIG is a program which generates remote procedure call (RPC) code for communication between client and server processes in a Mach based operating system.

Mach servers run as separate tasks and communicate with inter-process communication (IPC) messages. This IPC interface is language independant and faily complex. This is where MIG steps in. Mig is capable of generating the RPC code for the client-server communication.

GNU MIG is fully compatible with OSF MIG.
