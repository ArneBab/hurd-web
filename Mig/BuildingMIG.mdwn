# <a name="Building_the_Mach_Interface_Gene"> Building the Mach Interface Generator from Source </a>

If you want to build the Mach Interface Generator yourself instead of just using a pre-built package, follow these instructions.

## <a name="Getting_the_Source_Code"> Getting the Source Code </a>

You can chose between getting the [sources from the developers's RCS](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mig-download.html#cvs):

    $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/hurd co mig

... or (if you are working on a Debian system) the ones that are used for the [current Debian mig package](http://packages.debian.net/source/unstable/mig):

    $ apt-get source mig

Please see [[Distrib/DebianFAQ]] before using _apt-get source_.

The unpacked source tree is around [TODO]MiB, and the build tree is around [TODO]MiB.

### <a name="_on_Debian_systems"> ... on Debian systems </a>

Building the Mach Interface Generator requires the _build-essential_ and _fakeroot_ packages, their dependencies and additional packages that are specified by the source mig package:

    # apt-get install build-essential fakeroot
    # apt-get build-dep mig

Change into the directory with the downloaded / unpacked MIG sources, e.g.

    $ cd mig-[TODO]

Start the build process with

    $ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b -rfakeroot
