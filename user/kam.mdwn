#Roadmap

##Progress

###Preparation Phase:

Understanding how gnumach ticks [ at least the parts related to the project ]

---

####28th of April - 5th of May:

* Reading the paging in code in gnumach.
* Reading the libpager code, and the multipage patch.
* Reading the translators code, only the part implementing the external pager interface.

####5th of May - 12th of May:

* Reading the paging out code in gnumach.
* Understanding IPC in gnumach and reading some code.
* Reading "[gnu_src]/kern/sched_prim.c"

####12th of May - 19th of May:

* Finishing the leftover code in some of the previous phases.
* Building a big and a more clear picture of how gnumach ticks [ wiring things together ].

####19th of May - 23th of May:

* Off [College related-activities].

---

###Coding Phase:


####24th of May - 26th of May:

* Read the freeBSD multipages implementation.
* Basic Modifications of gnumach's code.
* err.. scratch this step. It's easier to work on porting OSF Mach's implementation of multi-pages.

####26th of May - 28th of May:

* port OSF Mach's clustered pagein during 'page faults' ( [src]/vm/vm_fault.c )
* port "cluster_size" attribute of memory objects from OSF Mach.
* port "behavior" attribute of vm_map entries from OSF Mach.

####29th of May - 2nd of June:

* Off ( Oral Exams )

---

####2nd of May - 4th of June:

* Finish the port of the previous phase.

---

####5th of June - 11th of June:

* Modify the API of the libpager to support multipages.

---

####12th of June - 26th of June:

* Modify the of the translators code to implement the new libpager interface.

---

####27th of June - 30th of June:

* port OSF Mach's clustered pageout ( [src]/vm/vm_pageout.c )

---

####1st of July - 4th of July:

* Fix the bootmem_allocator patch along with my proposal.

---

### Testing Phase:

---

### Exams Schedule:

#### Final exams :

Starts at 12th of June for two weeks [maybe 2 or 3 days longer than this , not sure]
