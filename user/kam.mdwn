#Roadmap

##Progress

###Preparation Phase:
Understanding how gnumach ticks [ at least the parts related to the project ]
---
####28th of April - 5th of May:
* Reading the paging in code in gnumach.
* Reading the libpager code, and the multipage patch.
* Reading the translators code, only the part implementing the external pager interface.

####5th of May - 12th of May:
* Reading the paging out code in gnumach.
* Reading the IPC Code in gnumach.
* Reading "[gnu_src]/kern/sched_prim.c"

####12th of May - 19th of May:
* Finishing the leftover code in some of the previous phases.
* Building a big and a more clear picture of how gnumach ticks [ wiring things together ].

####19th of May - 23th of May:
* Finishing the previous state if not finished.
* Discussing the details of implementing the multipage support.

---

###Coding Phase:
---
* Modify vm_fault_page(..) in [gnumach_src]/vm/vm_fault.c to pagein multi-pages.
* Add a new attribute to memory_object called "cluster_size" and allow pager to set/modify it.
* Modify vm_pageout_page(..) in [gnumach_src]/vm_pageout.c to pageout multi-pages.
* Modify the API of the libpager to support multipages.
* Modify the translators ( console, ext2fs, fatfs, isofs, storeio, ufs ) to implement the new libpager API.
