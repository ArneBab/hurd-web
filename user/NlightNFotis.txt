       - I have managed to sent all the paperwork required by the FSF for copyright assignment, which included copyright assignments for GLIBC, GCC, GNU Mach and the GNU Hurd. (Also have got the Full legal documents which I have signed and sent from the 20th of June, and am currently waiting for an acknowledgment).

              - More detailed:

                    - I have read the Critique (although I want to revisit it soon http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/critique.html)
                    - I have read Marcus Brinkmann's presentation of the Hurd (http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-talk.html)
                    - I have read the article "Examining the Legendary Hurd Kernel" on informit (http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1180992)
                    - I have managed to read the Hurd User's Guide (http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/users-guide/using_gnuhurd.html)
                    - I have read the articles Ghost's of Unix Past on lwn.net (http://lwn.net/Articles/411845/, http://lwn.net/Articles/412131/, http://lwn.net/Articles/414618/)
                    - I have read the Hurd Hacking Guide (http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hacking-guide/hhg.html)
                    - Apart from those I have read plenty other small documents available on the Hurd Website.

       - I have read some documents on the GCC (need to read more).
             - More detailed:
                    - Read a general document on GCC architecture in wikibooks (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GNU_C_Compiler_Internals/GNU_C_Compiler_Architecture)
                    - Read some of the documents in The Getting Started page of the gcc wiki, including:
                          - The Basics: Contributing to GCC in 10 easy steps (have read and understood all of the steps required)
                          - I have read the blog posts about building a new GCC front end at this blog (http://blog.lxgcc.net/?page_id=116)
                          - I have seen (although feel I have to revisit) all the slides of the Essential Abstractions in GCC Workshop (http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/grc/gcc-workshop-10/index.php?page=slides)
                          - I have read some papers on GCC (mostly by Diego Novillo) on the current status and the architecture of GCC. Revisiting them as we speak. They are located here (http://www.airs.com/dnovillo/Papers/#cgo2007)
                          - Have also read plenty of presentations on GCC Internals and architecture, as well as GCC from a user's standpoint. Will revisit them today or tomorrow (http://www.seketeli.org/dodji/talks/eigen-2010/gcc-eigen-2010.pdf, http://guerby.org/ftp/gcc-toulibre-20091216.pdf

       - I have managed to setup a working environment.
             - I am running the Hurd on a virtual machine. My setup is a Debian GNU/Linux physical box (host) and Debian GNU/Hurd (QEMU guest)
             - It is running ok (performance wise). (KVM modules have been enabled, and QEMU-KVM is installed, processor is VT-x, VT-d enabled)
             - I have also set up working repositories in Github for GCC, Hurd and Mach. They are available under my Github account here (https://github.com/NlightNFotis?tab=repositories)
             - Those repositories are all cloned and working under both the Hurd and Linux. However, GIT under the Hurd is having some issues that I am currently investigating, that corrupt repositories (and seem fairly dangerous for the filesystem too)

       - I also managed to read two books that I perceived as beneficial for my work. The first one was Operating Systems in Depth (http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP001803.html) and the second one was Version Control with Git (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596520137.do, Edit: I knew how to use git before reading this, but I read this book in order to leverage my knowledge seeing as I am about to work professionally with Git)

       - My Plans for the rest of the week and the week to come:

            - Finish reading the documentation for both GCC and the Hurd (will have done so until Friday. Maximum Saturday. It won't take more than that.)
            - Start hacking in the projects source code.
            - I also plan to (given that I find the time) continue reading some books to enhance both my skills and knowledge, with the next in my list being Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets (http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298)

       - Addressing the issue regarding my failure to attend the weekly IRC meeting:
            - This is something that I am taking full responsibility for, and would like to apologize for to anyone affected.
            - I would also like to apologize to my mentors for dissappointing them with my lack of communication so early in the summer.
            - However, I would like my mentors (and anyone else for that matter) know that I will do my *VERY* best to avoid situations like this in the future.
                  - From now on I will be available all day long (unless I am out of house) in the #Hurd channel in freenode under the usual nickname NlightNFotis. Just ping me if you would like to ask anything.
                  - I am pretty open to criticism and suggestions. If my mentors (or anyone else for that matter) find that I fall short in any aspect (such as that issue that arose) please communicate it with me upfront. I generally appreciate criticism and try get better based on it.
                  - I will also try to be more open regarding my progress. I will try to do mini reports on a daily basis on the #Hurd channel, and possibly also use my blog for more detailed reports on my progress.
