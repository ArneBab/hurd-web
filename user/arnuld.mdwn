## Education

## Future Plans

* Want to start my own business, totally based on a new paradigm of copyleft softwares. It will be
both a new-paradigm and a sudden-shock to present corporate. New-Paradigm because probably nearly all
software companies use software-patents and Proprietary licenses to make money and I will be the one
who will bring a new software business practice that will be adopted by every software company, sooner
or later. A sudden-shock  because then everybody will think "Why I did not think of it ?" and after 10
years form now, using Proprietary licenses and Software-Patents to make money will be a totally useless 
idea in business.

* yeah, want to learn Jeet-Kuan-Do. i love it as much as i love the copyleft concept :)
