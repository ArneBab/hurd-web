October 3, 2010 - I just try to become an end user of The Hurd. In 2004, I was able to install K9 on an old computer.
These times, my goal is to install it on my laptop (maybe with crosshurd or with a lzma image for virtualbox, or any other way...)

Also, I'm currently working on a comics'The Call Of The Hurd'. It's free licensed cc-by-sa/Copyleft Art Libre.
1st page will be done before the end of the year I think (I look for good quality).

October 13, 2010 - Page 1 out ! The beginning of the [the comics is here :](http://eldreammachine.free.fr/gaetan/TheCallOfTheHurd-01.jpg)
Hope it will pleased for you.
