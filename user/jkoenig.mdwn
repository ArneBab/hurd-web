## Hurd Debian-Installer

My [proposal](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/HurdDebianInstaller/JeremieKoenig)
to work on porting d-i on Hurd
as a [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) student
has been accepted by the Debian project.

I will be keeping track of my progress on this page.

### Latest news (eg., notes to myself for tomorrow morning)

  * *busybox*:
    patches [posted](http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2010/05/msg00048.html)
    to debian-{bsd,hurd}@l.d.o.
    I should notify the upstream list and #323670.
  * while not going very var, *d-i images do boot*
    when using hurd-udeb and ext2fs.static from the latest pkg-hurd,
    plus my own modification to add the /lib/ld.so symlink to it.
    Should it be done there?
    Is ldconfig supposed to create it when the d-i images are built?
    Anyway, I'll try to get debian-installer to start.

### Mostly done

#### Week 1 (2010-05-24)

* genext2fs: patches [submitted](http://bugs.debian.org/562999)
  which add support for all block sizes and choosing them at runtime.
* busybox: started porting the upstream and Debian package to Hurd and FreeBSD
* rebuilding hurd-udeb from the pkg-hurd version
  and adding a ld.so link to the initrd
  fixes the exec translator crashing on startup.
  (BTW would there be a mean to detect this from the libdiskfs bootstrap code
  and report it ?)

### Roadmap

#### Week 2 (2010-05-31)

* see what breaks in the installer and fix the problems one by one
  (install-time netcfg, cdrom detection, whatever)
* start working on mach initrd support

#### Week 3 (2010-06-07)

* try to get the busybox changes merged upstream
  and integrated into the debian package
* tweak the hurd debian package to handle
  what native-install used to be required for

#### Week 4 (2010-06-14)

* Hurd-specific partitionning (use supported fs types and options)
* grub2 installation

#### Week 5-6 (2010-06-21)

* unexpected stuff
* cleanup
* call for testing
* fix bugs

At this point we would have a basic but working installer.
Hopefully the summer would not be over yet...

#### Week 7-8 (2010-07-05)

* hurd console
* better DHCP support during and after installation
* support more types of installation images

#### Week 9-10 (2010-07-19)

* give a shot at the graphical installer ?

#### Week 11-12 (2010-08-02)

* test, fix, document
