## Hurd Debian-Installer

My [proposal](http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/HurdDebianInstaller/JeremieKoenig)
to work on porting d-i on Hurd
as a [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) student
has been accepted by the Debian project.

I will be keeping track of my progress on this page.

### Latest news

  * *busybox*:
    patches [posted](http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2010/05/msg00048.html).
    I need to test them on kFreeBSD,
    then submit them upstream and to #323670.
  * installation images boot with the following changes:
      * rebuild hurd-udeb from with the latest pkg-hurd patches
      * use busybox from my osports-debian branch (see link above)
      * tweak the d-i image build scripts
      * the symlink /lib/ld.so -> ld.so.1 needs to be created somehow
        (youpi mentionned it being the job of libc0.3-udeb I think)
      * fix the poll() issue in libdebian-installer
        (patch to be submitted soon),
        also there is some hurd doxygen short-circuiting stuff
        there which does not apply any more and prevents is to build.
      * initrd support coming soon (BTW gnumach does not like gcc-4.4),
        for the time being it needs to be fed to qemu as a hard drive
        (with some more space added to avoid it from becoming full)

### Roadmap

#### Week 2 (2010-05-31 to 2010-06-06)

* see what breaks in the installer and fix the problems one by one
  (install-time netcfg, cdrom detection, whatever)
* start working on mach initrd support

#### Week 3 (2010-06-07..13)

* try to get the busybox changes merged upstream
  and integrated into the debian package
* tweak the hurd debian package to handle
  what native-install used to be required for

#### Week 4 (2010-06-14..20)

* Hurd-specific partitionning (use supported fs types and options).
  NB: we will need support in mach to reload the partition tables,
  or alternatively use the parted support in libstore somehow.
* grub2 installation

#### Week 5-6 (2010-06-21..07-04)

* unexpected stuff
* cleanup
* call for testing
* fix bugs

At this point we would have a basic but working installer.
Hopefully the summer would not be over yet...

#### Week 7-8 (2010-07-05..18)

* hurd console
* better DHCP support during and after installation
* support more types of installation images

#### Week 9-10 (2010-07-19..08-01)

* give a shot at the graphical installer ?

#### Week 11-12 (2010-08-02..15)

* test, fix, document


### Mostly done

#### Week 1 (2010-05-24)

* genext2fs: patches [submitted](http://bugs.debian.org/562999)
  which add support for all block sizes and choosing them at runtime.
* busybox: started porting the upstream and Debian package to Hurd and FreeBSD
* rebuilding hurd-udeb from the pkg-hurd version
  and adding a ld.so link to the initrd
  fixes the exec translator crashing on startup.
  (BTW would there be a mean to detect this from the libdiskfs bootstrap code
  and report it ?)
