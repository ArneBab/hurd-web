I am a Hurd enthusiast and occasional contributor,
currently a M.Sc. student at University of Strasbourg.
Among other things I am interested in formal methods,
languages and operating system design.

Contributions include:

  * Help [[port debian-installer|d-i]],
    as a GSoC student for the Debian project during the summer of 2010.
  * Rewrite the procfs translator
    ([bug-hurd](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-08/msg00165.html)
     [thread](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-09/msg00001.html)).
  * In 2011 I worked as a GSoC student again,
    this time for the GNU project,
    on [[improving Java support|java]].
    This work is ongoing.
