ToDo
----

The output of `grep -R PATH_MAX auto-apt-0.3.22/*` is a bit long. It contains files that have been patched using `#define PATH_MAX XYZ`.  
Here is the only file of interest:

    pkgcdb/pkgtab.c:    char buf[PATH_MAX];
    pkgcdb/pkgtab.c:    assert(p - pkg < PATH_MAX);
    pkgcdb/pkgtab.c:    static char buf[PATH_MAX];
    pkgcdb/pkgtab.c:    assert(len < PATH_MAX);
