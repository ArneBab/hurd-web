rng-tools
=========

Daemon to use a Hardware TRNG. The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number generator) such as the ones in some Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets, and the kernel's PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).  
(from [[http://packages.debian.org/lenny/rng-tools]])

Here is the output of `grep -R PATH_MAX rng-tools-2-unofficial-mt.14/*`:

    viapadlock_engine.c:static char cpudev_path[PATH_MAX+1];

Comments

Work in progress, see related [thread](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2012/01/msg00177.html).

Even if the **PATH_MAX** can be easily fixed, some problems remain.  
The code uses `linux/types.h`, that has to be replaced by `sys/types.h`, but also uses `linux/random.h` which has no equivalent I know of.  
At least one source file is named after the OS: `rngd_linux.c`.
