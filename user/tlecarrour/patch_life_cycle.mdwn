    Hi,

    This patch solves the build problems for GNU/Hurd due to PATH_MAX
    issues. The solution is to make dynamic string allocations instead of
    using fixed length buffers. The patch involves one file, and is
    trivial.

    FIXME:
    Is it really useful to check if BUFSIZ is defined?

    TODO:
    Should the "whole package" be tested with valgrind on GNU/Linux?!
    If yes, is there a standard procedure to do it?!

    Thanks! 
    Special thanks to Jérémie and Richard for their comments!

    (Not submitted yet, comments are welcome.)
