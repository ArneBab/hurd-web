Work in progress...

Only the function that fills the buffer knows how long it can be.  
This function is `RAND_file_name()` and is part of **OpenSSL**.

Probably **OpenSSL** function has to be fixed first to accept `NULL` buffer.  
Then fix the up-imapproxy code to use the new version of the function.
