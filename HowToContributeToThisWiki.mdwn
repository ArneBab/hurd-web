# How to Contribute to This Wiki

There are essentially three possibilities.  They are outlined below.


Some general hints; just as in software projects:

* Do independent changes *separately*: don't aggregate changes that don't
  belong together.
* Install your changes *early* and *often*: don't hold your contribution back
  until you think it is perfect.


If you are editing the source files from a git checkout you can nevertheless
have them get rendered to html pages:

	$ wiki/render_locally
	[...]
	scanning HowToContributeToThisWiki.mdwn
	rendering HowToContributeToThisWiki.mdwn
	
	Now open `wiki.rendered/index.html' to browse the wiki pages.


## Edit Via the Web Interface

When you found a page you want to work on, just follow the *Edit* link on the
top of the page.  When doing this for the first time, this will first transfer
you to a page where you have to create a wiki account.  After logging in, you
can edit the wiki pages.


## Do an Anonymous Checkout of the git Repository

*Not yet available.*

Check out the wiki.

	$ git clone git://flubber.bddebian.com/wiki [dest]

If you omit *[dest]* it will default to *wiki*.

Then you can work on these files.

	$ cd wiki/
	$ emacs Hurd/NextHurd.mdwn
	$ git commit Hurd/NextHurd.mdwn

Finally publish your changes.

	$ [TODO]


## Do a Read-write Checkout of the git Repository

For being able to do that you need a
[[shell_account_on_*flubber*|Hurd/PublicHurdBoxen]].  (It's very much
recommenable that you set up your local *ssh* configuration as advised on that
page.)

Check out the wiki.

	$ git clone flubber:~wiki/wiki [dest]

If you omit *[dest]* it will default to *wiki*.

Then you can work on these files.

	$ cd wiki/
	$ emacs Hurd/NextHurd.mdwn
	$ git commit Hurd/NextHurd.mdwn

Finally install your changes.

	$ git push
