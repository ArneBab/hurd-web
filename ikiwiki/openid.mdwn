[OpenID](http://openid.net) is a decentralized authentication mechanism
that allows you to have one login that you can use on a growing number of
websites.

If you have an account with some of the larger web service providers,
you might already have an OpenID.

[[!if test="enabled(openid)" then="""
To sign in to this wiki using OpenID, just enter it in the OpenID field in the
signin form. You do not need to give this wiki a password or go through any
registration process when using OpenID.

It's also possible to make a page in the wiki usable as an OpenID url,
by delegating it to an openid server. Here's an example of how to do that:

	\[[!meta openid="http://yourid.myopenid.com/"
	       server="http://www.myopenid.com/server"]]
