A principal is an accountable entity.  A principal may be
a user.  On some computer systems, users are represented by their
respective UID.  A process may also be a principal.  However, a
principal may span multiple processes (a web request that causes
a CGI script to be invoked) or a principal may contain a number
of separate principals (a web server serves multiple requests,
each request represents a different principal).
