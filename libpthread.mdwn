# Specifics

Porting libpthread to a specific architecture is non-trivial.

Our libpthread is currently used by/ported to the [[Hurd]] on [[GNU
Mach|microkernel/mach/gnumach]], and [[microkernel/Viengoos]].


# History

There has been a libpthread port for Hurd on L4 use (working directly on L4: no
further OS personality support required), which was dead and has been removed
in commit a0bca9895bca67591127680860077b2658830e96.  This had been superseded
by a [[microkernel/Viengoos]] port, which has its own branches:
`master-viengoos` (an implementation of Viengoos that runs on L4) and its
successor, `master-viengoos-on-bare-metal` (runs directly on x86-64 (and it a
bit more advanced) and provides everything that `master-viengoos` does and
more).

There has also been an incomplete and unmaintained PowerPC port which has been
removed in commit a5387f6a45d6b3f2b381d861f5c288b79da6204f.
