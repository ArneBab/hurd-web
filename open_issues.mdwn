[[!meta title="Open Issues"]]

This is a dumping ground for open issues.

If you register a new issue, please supply some suitable [[tag
directive|ikiwiki/directive]]s to make sure that your report shows up on the
relevant lists of open issues.  Tags that are currently in active use are the
following:

[[!map pages="tag/* and !tag/*/* and !tag/open_issue_mach"
show=title]]

Most of them should be self-explanatory.  *fixed_in_debian* is used to tag
items that have been fixed in the [[Debian GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]]
distribution, but not yet in the upstream sources.
