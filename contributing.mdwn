# The system itself

First thing to do then is to get access to a GNU/Hurd system.  Installing
[[Debian_GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] will probably be the easiest and most
feature-complete solution.  If you don't have spare hardware to use for doing
so, you can also get a
[[shell_account_on_a_public_Hurd_machine|public_hurd_boxen]].  Depending on the
things you're going to work on (and on your internet connection), this may be
an easy way of getting used to Hurd systems.

Then you can either play around and eventually strive to do something
useful or -- if you want -- ask us to assign something to you, depending
on the skills you have and the resources you intend to invest.

See <http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/devel.html> for details,
<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/docs.html> for documents,
<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/> in general and also this whole wiki, of
course.
