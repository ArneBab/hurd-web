So, I'm brand-new here and to Hurd. I found it easiest to write three different entries into into the grub menu.lst - a single user entry for the 'native-install', one for the old serversboot.gz method and one with the boot modules options written in. This way even re-installing from scratch I'm saved a bit of tedious typing. -- [[Main/MauriceMcCarthy]] - 30 Oct 2004.
