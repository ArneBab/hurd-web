I have tried knoppix/gnoppix. I know the hurd is still a work in progress, but I would like to start working on a bootable cd.

I think choice and ease of use would bring a lot more to the project. BSD and Linux have a live cd distribution. I would like to implment this on other systems Hurd, GNU/Darwin.

The BSD live distribution Freesbie has a toolkit to create a customized live cd for yourself. I would like to start with porting this toolkit to the Hurd. I like the flexibility of the BSD version.

I also see debian packages have some issues? Is there any interest in bring rpm or a Fink system to the Hurd?
