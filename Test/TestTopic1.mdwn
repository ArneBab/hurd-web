* Is there any reason to create a live Hurd Distribution?\*

**I could use some of the tools from BSD/LINUX to make a Live Hurd CD** **I mean try** **Anyone else think this is worth it?** **I would like to create a package to create such cds for rescue use** \*I think perhaps a bootable DVD would be the way to go eventually \* **I would like to put the main os on a dvd and then have freedos and thier options in a bootmenu** **It would be cool to have the images mountable under bochs from the other bootable OS(s)**
