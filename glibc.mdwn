# Specifics


## Ports

Porting glibc to a specific architecture is non-trivial.

The main port is x86, which is somewhat complete and is maintained.  There is
an incomplete and unmaintained port for PowerPC.  There [[!message-id
desc="have" "20111129161104.25123.qmail@sourceware.org"]] [[!message-id
desc="been" "Pine.LNX.4.64.1111291611170.26895@digraph.polyomino.org.uk"]]
incomplete and largely unmaintained ports for Alpha and MIPS in glibc-ports.


## [[Hurd-specific Port|hurd/glibc]]

An important part of the [[Hurd]] actually resides in glibc: here, the POSIX
interfaces are implemented on top of the [[Hurd IPC protocols|hurd/interface]].
This is different to the Linux port, where most simple POSIX interfaces are in
fact simply forwarded to/implemented as [[system_call]]s.

# Implementation Details

  * [[hurd/glibc/Hurd-specific API]]

  * [[open_issues/secure_file_descriptor_handling]]

  * [[signal/signal_thread]]

  * [[startup]]


## Concepts

  * [[environment_variable]]

  * [[file_descriptor]]

  * [[process]]

  * [[signal]]

  * [[ioctl]]


## Individual functions

Some of these are well-known as [[UNIX]] [[system call]]s.

  * [[fallocate]]

  * [[fork]]

  * [[poll]]
