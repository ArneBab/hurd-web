## Sources

For concenience, we maintain our own [[source
repository|source_repositories/glibc]].


# Specifics


## Ports

Porting glibc to a specific architecture is non-trivial.

The main port is x86, which is somewhat complete and is maintained.  There were
incomplete ports for Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC, but they were unmaintained and
have been removed.


## [[Hurd-specific Port|hurd/glibc]]

An important part of the [[Hurd]] actually resides in glibc: here, the POSIX
interfaces are implemented on top of the [[Hurd IPC protocols|hurd/interface]].
This is different to the Linux port, where most simple POSIX interfaces are in
fact simply forwarded to/implemented as [[system_call]]s.

  * [[signal/signal_thread]]

  * [[startup]]


## Concepts

  * [[environment_variable]]

  * [[file_descriptor]]

  * [[process]]

  * [[signal]]

  * [[ioctl]]


## Individual functions

Some of these are well-known as [[UNIX]] [[system call]]s.

  * [[fallocate]]

  * [[fork]]
