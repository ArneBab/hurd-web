A persistent object is an object that survives reboot.
On Unix, files and directories are persistent but
processes and file descriptors are not.  EROS is
an example of an orthogonally persistent system:
processes and capabilities also survive reboot.  To a
process, it generally only looks as if it had not been
scheduled for a long time; the rest of its environment
remains essentially the indistinguishable.
