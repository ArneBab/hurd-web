A persistent object is an object that survives reboot.
On [[Unix]], files and directories are persistent but
processes and file descriptors are not.  [[microkernel/EROS]] is
an example of an orthogonally persistent system:
processes and capabilities also survive reboot.  To a
process, it generally only looks as if it had not been
scheduled for a long time; the rest of its environment
remains essentially the indistinguishable.
