IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2011-10-19:

    <tschwinge> pinotree: Nice!  And that open(FIFO, O_RDWR) hanging issue may
      warrant investigation on the Hurd side, too -- if the other systems
      behave differently, we should probably have convincing reasons for our
      behavior.
    <pinotree> i gue somebody working on hurd never cared about that case - i
      guess it falls back to one of O_RDONLY or O_WRONLY
    <pinotree> *guess
