This works:

    $ touch a && settrans a /hurd/symlink b

This doesn't:

    $ mkdir a && settrans a /hurd/symlink b
    settrans: a: Is a directory

It's the same `file_set_translator` RPC both times, and it's [[translator
short-circuiting|hurd/translator/short-circuiting]] which makes the latter one
fail:

`libdiskfs/file-set-trans.c`:

    [...]
      /* Set passive translator */
      if (passive_flags & FS_TRANS_SET)
        {
          if (!(passive_flags & FS_TRANS_FORCE))
            {
              /* Handle the short-circuited translators */
              mode_t newmode = 0;
    
              if (diskfs_shortcut_symlink && !strcmp (passive, _HURD_SYMLINK))
                newmode = S_IFLNK;
              [...]
    
              if (newmode)
                {
                  if (S_ISDIR (np->dn_stat.st_mode))
                    {
                      /* We can't allow this, because if the mode of the directory
                         changes, the links will be lost.  Perhaps it might be
                         allowed for empty directories, but that's too much of a
                         pain.  */
                      mutex_unlock (&np->lock);
                      return EISDIR;
                    }
