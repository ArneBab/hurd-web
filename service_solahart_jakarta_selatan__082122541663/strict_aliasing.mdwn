    <braunr> we should perhaps build the hurd with -fno-strict-aliasing,
      considering the number of warnings i can see during the build :/
    <pinotree> braunr: wouldn't be better to "just" fix the mig-generated stubs
      instead?
    <braunr> pinotree: if we can rely on gcc for the warnings, yes
    <braunr> but i suspect there might be other silent issues in very old code


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-12

    <braunr> btw, i'm building glibc right now, and i can see a few strict
      aliasing warnings
    <braunr> fixing them will allow us to avoid wasting time on very obscure
      issues (if gcc catches them all)
    <tschwinge> The strict aliasing things should be fixed, yes.  Some might be
      from MIG.


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-17

    <braunr> we should build gnumach and the hurd with -fno-strict-aliasing
    <pinotree> aren't the mig-generated stubs the only issues related to that?
    <braunr> no
    <teythoon> b/c we often have pointers of different type pointing to the
      same address? for example code using libports?
    <braunr> the old linux code, including pfinet, and even the hurd libraries,
      use techniques that assume aliasing
    <braunr> exactly
    <teythoon> right, I agree
