    <youpi> azeem: I think I found why apt-get throws Hurd down sometimes
    <youpi> the problem is that it basically write(file, 20MB); fsync();
    <youpi> i.e. it throws a storm of dirty-writeback to ext2fs
    <youpi> which thus goes into throttling threads
    <youpi> since posix explicitely says that fsync() can be void, I think  I'll patch apt-get on the buildd
    <youpi> (that bug has bitten me too many times in the past days to let it go further)
    <youpi> for now it works
    * youpi crosses fingers
