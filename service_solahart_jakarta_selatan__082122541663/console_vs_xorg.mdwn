    [1987693.272] Cannot set event mode on keyboard (Inappropriate ioctl for device)

    <braunr> hum
    <braunr> it looks like the xorg keyboard driver evolved and now uses ioctls
      our drivers don't implement
    <braunr> thanks for the report, we'll have to work on this
    <braunr> i'm not sure the problem is new actually
