    <teythoon> that's new
    <braunr> teythoon: ouch
    <teythoon> braunr: everything works fine though
    <braunr> teythoon: that part isn't too surprising
    <teythoon> y?
    <braunr> teythoon: /dev/null already existed, didn't it ?
    <teythoon> braunr: sure, yes


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-19

    <braunr> hm
    <braunr> i'm seeing those /sbin/MAKEDEV: cannot create /dev/null:
      Interrupted system call messages too


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-20

    <teythoon> braunr: interesting, I've seen some of those as well

    <gg0> cannot create /dev/null: Interrupted system call
    <gg0>
      http://gnashdev.org:8010/builders/z-sid-hurd-i386/builds/26/steps/system_upgrade/logs/stdio

    <anatoly> gg0: I had same /dev/null error after upgrading my old image
      (more than 6 months old) a week ago. But I got such message only on boot
      and it didn't autostart hurd console.
    <anatoly> Tried to upgrade current qemu image (from topic) to reproduce it
      but it works OK after upgrade
    <gg0> i can reproduce it with # apt-get install --reinstall python2.7 dbus
      # for instance
    <gg0> http://paste.debian.net/plain/78566/
    <teythoon> gg0: i've seen those as well, but i cannot reliably reproduce it
      to track it down
    <teythoon> i believe it's benign though
    <gg0> in shell scripts if -e is set, it aborts on failures like those
    <teythoon> uh, it does? :/
    <gg0> so if this happens in prerm/postinst scripts, package is not properly
      installed/removed/configured and it fails
    <gg0> redirecting stdout and strerr to /dev/null shouldn't be so
      problematic, anything wrong in my setup?
    <gg0> can you reproduce it?
    <teythoon> not reliably
    <teythoon> gg0: but i do not believe that anything is wrong with your
      machine
    <gg0> any way to debug it?
    <teythoon> having a minimal test case that triggers this reliably would be
      great
    <teythoon> but i fear it might be a race


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-01-28

    <teythoon> have you seen the /dev/null issue ?
    <braunr> yes
    <teythoon> what do you make of it ?
    <braunr> no idea
    <teythoon> i believe it is related to the inlining work i've done
    <braunr> just like the bogus deallocation at boot, it needs debugging :)
    <braunr> hm i don't think so
    <teythoon> no ?
    <braunr> i think we saw it even before your started working on the hurd ;p
    <teythoon> i've never seen it before my recent patches
    <teythoon> maybe i made it worse
    <braunr> not worse, just exposed more
    <teythoon> right


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-01-29

    <gg0> cannot reproduce "cannot create /dev/null: Interrupted system call"
      on a faster VM
    <gg0> might depend on that?


## IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2014-02-02

    <pere> but now saw a strange message at the end of the boot:
      /etc/init.dhurd-console: 55: /etc/init.d/hurd-console: cannot create
      /dev/null: Interrupted system call
    <gg0> oh well known on a slow VM (even old qemu/kvm btw), i can't reproduce
      it on a faster/more recent one
    <gg0> slow VM = gnash buildbot slave
      http://gnashdev.org:8010/builders/z-sid-hurd-i386/builds/26/steps/system_upgrade/logs/stdio
    <gg0> especially bad on system upgrade because it doesn't finish to run
      prerm/postinst scripts :/

    <gg0> typical dist-upgrade http://paste.debian.net/plain/81346/
    <gg0> many fewer cannot create /dev/null: Interrupted system call
    <gg0> on a faster machine
    <teythoon> gg0: wow, so many interrupted system call messages
    <teythoon> i don't get as many, but makedev produces a few every time i run
      it as well


## IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2014-02-16

    <pere> anyone here got any idea why upgrading initscripts fail on the hurd
      gnash autobuilder, as reported on <URL:
      http://gnashdev.org:8010/builders/z-sid-hurd-i386/builds/28/steps/system_upgrade/logs/stdio
      >?
    <gg0> pere: cannot create /dev/null: Interrupted system call
    <pere> gg0: I noticed the message, but fail to understand how this could
      happen.
    <gg0> 13:16 < gg0> oh well known on a slow VM (even old qemu/kvm btw), i
      can't reproduce it on a faster/more recent one
    <gg0> 13:17 < gg0> slow VM = gnash buildbot slave
      http://gnashdev.org:8010/builders/z-sid-hurd-i386/builds/26/steps/system_upgrade/logs/stdio
    <gg0> 13:18 < gg0> especially bad on system upgrade because it doesn't
      finish to run prerm/postinst scripts :/
    <gg0> i remember teythoon talking about something racy
    <teythoon> gg0: the /dev/null issue is known for a long time
    <teythoon> gg0: some of the recent work (i believe mine) has made the
      problem more apparent
    <teythoon> gg0: that's what braunr told me
    <gg0> i see. it would be really nice fixing it. really annoying. i
      workaround it by moving null away and moving it back under /dev before
      halting/rebooting

    <tschwinge> Earlier today, I upgraded my Debian GNU/Hurd installation from
      several months ago, and I'm now seeing bogus things as follows; is that a
      known issue?
    <tschwinge>  checking for i686-unknown-gnu0.5-ar... ar
    <tschwinge>  configure: updating cache ./config.cache
    <tschwinge>  configure: creating ./config.status
    <tschwinge> +./config.status: 299: ./config.status: cannot create
      /dev/null: Interrupted system call
    <tschwinge>  config.status: creating Makefile
    <tschwinge> (The plus is from a build log diff.)
    <azeem> 13:36 < gg0> pere: cannot create /dev/null: Interrupted system call
    <azeem> 20:10 < teythoon> gg0: the /dev/null issue is known for a long time
    <tschwinge> Anyone working on resolving this?  I't causing build issues:
    <tschwinge> checking for i686-unknown-gnu0.5-ranlib... (cached) ranlib
    <tschwinge> checking command to parse nm output from gcc-4.8
      object... [...]/opcodes/configure: 6760: ./configure.lineno: cannot
      create /dev/null: Interrupted system call
    <tschwinge> failed
    <tschwinge> checking for dlfcn.h... yes
    <tschwinge> Anyway, will go researching IRC logs.
    <azeem> tschwinge: (that one was from #debian-hurd)
    <azeem> I assume teythoon and/or braunr can comment once he's back
    <azeem> they're*
    <braunr> tschwinge: we've been seing this more often lately but noone has
      attempted to fix it yet
    <braunr> tschwinge: if you have a reliable way to reproduce that /dev/null:
      Interrupted system call error, please let us know


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-02-23

    <gg0> braunr: cool. i'd vote /dev/null one as next one in your todo
    <gg0> still frequent on this slow vm
      http://gnashdev.org:8010/builders/z-sid-hurd-i386/builds/30/steps/system_upgrade/logs/stdio
    <gg0> especially during setup-translators -k
    <braunr> yes
