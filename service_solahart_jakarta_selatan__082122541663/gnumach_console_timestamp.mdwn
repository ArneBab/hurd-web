    <azeem> task 39011c10 deallocating an invalid port 349, most probably a
      bug.
    <azeem> kernel: Page fault (14), code=6
    <azeem> Stopped at  0x28b9c7:   orb     %bh,0(%ecx,%edi,2)
    <azeem> db> 
    [...]
    <antrik> tschwinge: I doubt the deallocating warning is related to the
      later fault
    <tschwinge> antrik: YOu may be right.
    <tschwinge> Perhaps it'd be a good idea to add some sort of timestamp to
      Mach messages.
    <tschwinge> Like in Linux' dmesg.
    <tschwinge> Or just RDTSC (internal processor counter).
