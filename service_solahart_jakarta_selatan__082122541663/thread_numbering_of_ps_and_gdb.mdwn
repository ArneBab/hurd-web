It appears to [[me|tschwinge]] that `ps -T` enumerates thread IDs starting with
zero, and GDB starting with one.  This should be unified.

Or instead of manually allocating numbers, some other handle should be used,
that has a global meaning for the running GNU Mach kernel, or a process-wide
meaning, for example a port number.
