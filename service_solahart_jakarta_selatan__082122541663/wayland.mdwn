    <antrik> Wayland should be very portable. all the system dependencies are
      in the infrastructure, such as DRI
    <antrik> we have had a DRI task (for X.Org) for years
    <antrik> (in fact I would be the right person to implement this,
      considering my background -- by quite frankly, I doubt I'll ever do it)

    <youlysses> Is wayland something that will be semi-easy to port to the
      hurd? I saw GNOME is heading in this direction.
    <pinotree> wayland at the moment is linux only
    <tschwinge> youlysses: A DRI implementation will be needed.
    <pinotree> that, and libdrm compiling
    <youlysses> So it will take some work ... but theres no *HUGE* design
      decison that would inhibit it?
    <pinotree> i know it uses epoll, for instance
    <tschwinge> youlysses: I cannot judge how complex a DRI system is, and how
      much needs to be designed vs. implemented.
