    <cfhammar> whats the difference between mach-defpager and defpager?
    <cfhammar> i'm guessing defpager is a hurdish version that uses libstore
      but was never finished or something
    <cfhammar> found an interesting thread about it:
      http://mirror.libre.fm/hurd/list/msg01232.html
    <slpz> antrik: an interesting thread, indeed :-)
    <pochu> slpz: btw is mach-defpager linked statically but not called
      mach-defpager.static on purpose?
    <slpz> antrik: also, I can confirm that mach-defpager needs a complete
      rewrite ;-)
    <slpz> pochu: I think the original defpager was launched by serverboot
    <slpz> pochu: that could be the reason to have it static, like ext2fs
    <slpz> and since there's no need to execute it again during the normal
      operation of the system, they probably decided to not create a
      dynamically linked version
    <slpz> (but I'm just guessing)
    <slpz> of perhaps they wanted to prevent mach-defpager from the need of
      reading libraries, since it's used when memory is really scarce (guessing
      again)
