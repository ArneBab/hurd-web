    <antrik> I have a theory
    <antrik> when the system is under CPU load, the ext2 locking issues are more likely to happen
    <antrik> I'm under the impression, that when doing something disk-intensive (like a compile job) *considerably* more often causes crashes, when doing *any* other activity in parallel -- be it other compile jobs, or CPU-only activities
    <antrik> thinking about it, I'm not sure whether CPU-intensive is the decisive criterium, or maybe RPC-intensive...
    <antrik> CPU load doesn't seem to have any effect -- neither alone, nor in combination with other testcases
