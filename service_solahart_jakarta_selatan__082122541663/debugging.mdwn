# Existing

We have debugging infrastructure.  For example:

  * [[GDB]]

  * [[GNU Mach debugging|microkernel/mach/gnumach/debugging]]

  * [[GNU Hurd debugging|hurd/debugging]], including
    [[hurd/debugging/rpctrace]], and more.


# To Do

  * [[glibc]]'s sotruss

  * [[ltrace]]

  * [[service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663/latrace]]

  * [[service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663/profiling]]

  * *Checkpoint/restart allows the state of a set of processes to be saved to
    persistent storage, then restarted at some future time* -- quoting from
    Jonathan Corbet's [2010 Linux Kernel Summit
    report](http://lwn.net/Articles/412749/).

    This is surely a very useful facility to have for reproducing failures, for
    example.  But on the other hand it's questionable how it can help with
    debugging failures in [[GNU Hurd server|hurd/translator]]s' interactions,
    as their state is typically spread between several processes.

  * [[crash_server}}, [[GDB_gcore]],
    <http://code.google.com/p/google-coredumper/>

  * [[community/gsoc/project_ideas/libdiskfs_locking]]

  * <http://lwn.net/Articles/415728/>, or <http://lwn.net/Articles/415471/> --
    just two examples; there's a lot of such stuff for Linux.
