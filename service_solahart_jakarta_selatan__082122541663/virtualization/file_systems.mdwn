Of course, it is possible to use commodity file systems on [[virtualized
systems|service_solahart_jakarta_selatan__082122541663/virtualization]], like [[hurd/translator/ext2fs]] or

  * Linux saw a patch for [*generic name to handle and open by handle
    syscalls*](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems/46648) posted,
    which in turn can be beneficial for a [[QEMU]] emulation of a 9P file
    system.  LWN's Jonathan Corbet covered this [*open by
    handle*](http://lwn.net/Articles/375888/) functionality on 2010-02-23.
