        IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-02-15:

            <tschwinge> ogi: The question was rather (IIRC) whether your
              university has the copyright of this project, given it was done
              on their time.
            <ogi> tschwinge: no problems with my university

    <ogi> braunr: i want to update my ext3fs server to ext4 actually
    <braunr> you have an ext3 server ?
    <ogi> braunr: this was my M.Sc. thesis and the 2G patch was a side effect
    <ogi> braunr: but it easily crashes under stress, so not usable
    <braunr> it does ?
    <ogi> braunr: it's not available for download ATM
    <braunr> are you sure it's not a thread storm issue caused by the
      unthrottled mach writebacks ?
    <ogi> braunr: i don't know, haven't looked at it since 2004
    <braunr> oh :)
    <braunr> ok
    <ogi> i have all ext3fs stuff archived, just haven't put it on
      http://fire.tower.3.bg/ yet
    <tschwinge> ogi: If the copyright situation is clear, we can put it into
      upstream Git repositories, no matter how dirty it is.
    <tschwinge> "dirty" in the sense of that it needs cleanup, has bugs, etc.
    <ogi> so at some point i want to audit libdiskfs and then continue with
      ext4fs: https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?1839
