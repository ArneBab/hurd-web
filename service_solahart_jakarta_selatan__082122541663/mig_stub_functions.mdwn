# RPC Stubs Implemented by Hand

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-07-28

    <teythoon> why is libfshelp/start-translator-long.c doing the fsys_startup
      rpcs by hand instead of using the mig generated stubs?


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-07-29

    <teythoon> btw, anyone knows why libfshelp/start-translator-long.c
      implements the fsys_startup rpc by hand?
    <braunr> teythoon: no idea
    <teythoon> maybe b/c of the need to specify a timeout? can one do that with
      the mig stubs?
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> select used to be implemented that way


# Generate the Request and Reply Routines from the Synchronous Routines

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-19

    <teythoon> btw, is there any reason why mig couldn't generate the request
      and reply routines from the synchronous routines?
    <braunr> i guess it could


# Compiler Optimization

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-02

    <teythoon> braunr: inlining the mach generated x_server_procedure functions
      shaved 5 minutes off my hurd package build :)
    <teythoon> i guess fakeroot-tcp benefits most from this... I'm going to try
      this w/o fakeroot and on real hardware shortly
    <braunr> teythoon: nice
    <teythoon> :)
