As reported in [[!message-id "87sj80yb3e.fsf@kepler.schwinge.homeip.net"]],
after a [[GCC]] build (native, so three stages bootstrap), we got:

  PID  UID  PPID  PGrp  Sess TH  Vmem   RSS %CPU     User   System Args
  449 1000     3     1     1 10118 782M 198M 0.0  0:40.78  2:26.65 /hurd/fifo

The other processes, in particular two instances of ext2fs and one of [[exec]],
looked reasonable.
