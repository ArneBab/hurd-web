    <tschwinge> gianluca, youpi: Why the value 32 for the TLB flushing decision, by the way?
    <youpi> completely arbitrary
    <tschwinge> I thought whether that might perhaps be worth a macro definition with a comment?
    <verte> what's the typical TLB size these days?
    <youpi> tschwinge: right
    <youpi> note that the 32 value would be probably different between native and xen
    <gianluca> tschwinge: just arbitrary
