<H3>What is the GNU Hurd?</H3>
<P>
The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.
The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel
to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and
other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar
kernels (such as Linux).

GNU/LinuxTag 2003 is now over and since there was a talk given about
the Hurd, a demo GNU/Hurd machine running and the sale of Hurd
t-shirts, Wolfgang J&auml;hrling decided to write a <A

summery</A> of what happened there.  Many thanks to Wolfgang
J&auml;hrling, Volker Dormeyer and Michael Banck!

The tarball for Debian GNU/Hurd that Marcus Brinkmann made over the
years has been discontinued in favour of Jeff Bailey's
<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/crosshurd">crosshurd</A> package.
To install Debian GNU/Hurd from now on, this package should be used.
Another Debian system is required to be installed on the same machine.
The GNU/Hurd installation guide is has not been updated yet.

For one month now, the pthread implementation by Neal Walfield is part
of the Hurd CVS source tree, and has been used to compile more
software for the Debian GNU/Hurd archive.  The lack of a POSIX
compatible thread library (the Hurd was based on the cthread
implementation that originally accompanied Mach) was a show stopper,
and we are happy about the possibility to not only compile more
applications, but also to start the work on migrating the Hurd source
code to pthreads.

<DD>A new article about <A HREF="/software/hurd/auth.html">the authentication
server</A> has been added to the web pages.  It resembles the talk
about the same topic which was given at the Libre Software Meeting,
therefore the target audience is mostly programmers which want to learn
about the details of authentication in the Hurd.
