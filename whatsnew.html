<H3>What is the GNU&nbsp;Hurd?</H3>
<P>
The GNU&nbsp;Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.
The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel
to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and
other features that are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar
kernels (such as Linux).
<P>
If you have any news related to the Hurd project, feel free to send a
news entry to <A HREF="mailto:web-hurd@gnu.org">web-hurd@gnu.org</A>
so that it can be added here.

<p>A number of GNU&nbsp;Hurd developers will again (as already in the previous
years) meet at the time of the FOSDEM&nbsp;2008, which will take place from
2008-02-23 to 24 in Brussels, Belgium.
<a href="http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/community/meetings/fosdem_2008/">This
wiki page</a> has some details.  <a href="/software/hurd/help.html">Contact
us</a> if you are interested in meeting with us.</p>

<p>This year the GNU Hurd had again been assigned one slot within
the <strong>Google Summer of Code</strong> program, which was assigned
to the task <strong>design and
implement <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?1619"><em>libchannel</em></a>,
a library for streams</strong>.  Carl Fredrik Hammar has been working on this
task and
recently <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2007-09/msg00009.html">posted
a summary</a> about the successful work he had been doing, but also gave an
outline about how he intends to continue improving and extending it.

<p>The GNU&nbsp;Hurd project will participate in this year's <strong>Google
Summer of Code</strong>, under the aegis of the GNU project.</p>

<p>The following is a list of items you might want to work on.  If you want to
modify these task proposals or have your own ideas on what to work, then please
don't hesitate to contact us on the <a
href="/software/hurd/help.html#mail">bug-hurd mailing list</a> or the <a
href="/software/hurd/help.html#irc">#hurd IRC channel</a>.</p>

href="http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?1619"><em>libchannel</em></a>, a library
for streams.</li>

<li>Rewrite <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?5469"><em>pfinet</em></a>,
our interface to the IPv4 world; create a <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?5470"><em>pfinet6</em></a> to interface to
the IPv6 world.</li>

<li>Make GNU Mach use more <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?5488">up to
date <em>device drivers</em></a>.</li>

<li>Design and implement a <a

client</em> and <em>NFSd</em></a>.</li>

<li>Implement support for <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/task/?5499"><em>Logical Volume Management
(LVM)</em></a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann have written and submitted for
publication <a
href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2007-01/msg00046.html"><em>A
Critique of the GNU&nbsp;Hurd Multi-server Operating System</em></a> and a <a
href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/l4-hurd/2007-01/msg00007.html">position
paper <em>Improving Usability via Access Decomposition and Policy
Refinement</em></a>.  Please follow the two preceding links to see the complete
announcements.  The authors welcome comments and discussion which may be
directed to the <a href="mailto:bug-hurd@gnu.org">&lt;bug-hurd@gnu.org&gt;
mailing list</a> for the Critique and to the <a
href="mailto:l4-hurd@gnu.org">&lt;l4-hurd@gnu.org&gt; mailing list</a> for the
position paper.

<p>The abstract of the Critique: <blockquote><p>The GNU&nbsp;Hurd's design was
motivated by a desire to rectify a number of observed shortcomings in Unix.
Foremost among these is that many policies that limit users exist simply as
remnants of the design of the system's mechanisms and their implementation.  To
increase extensibility and integration, the Hurd adopts an object-based
architecture and defines interfaces, which, in particular those for the
composition of and access to name spaces, are virtualizable.

<p>This paper is first a presentation of the Hurd's design goals and a
characterization of its architecture primarily as it represents a departure
from Unix's.  We then critique the architecture and assess it in terms of the
user environment of today focusing on security.  Then follows an evaluation of
Mach, the microkernel on which the Hurd is built, emphasizing the design
constraints which Mach imposes as well as a number of deficiencies its design
presents for multi-server like systems.  Finally, we reflect on the properties
such a system appears to require.</blockquote>

<p>The abstract of the position paper: <blockquote><p>Commodity operating
systems fail to meet the security, resource management and integration
expectations of users.  We propose a unified solution based on a capability
framework as it supports fine grained objects, straightforward access
propagation and virtualizable interfaces and explore how to improve resource
use via access decomposition and policy refinement with minimum interposition.
We argue that only a small static number of scheduling policies are needed in
practice and advocate hierarchical policy specification and central
realization.</blockquote></dd>
