**Category of a TWiki.Know topic**

The bottom part of a TWiki.Know topic has a category table. It is used to categorize a topic:

* [[UseCategory]]: Tell if the category table should be used or not
* [[TopicClassification]]: Classify a topic as public or confidential
* [[OperatingSystem]]: OS used
* [[OsVersion]]: OS version

When creating a topic it is important to set the appropriate values. This ensures that it is possible to do all kinds of query and search in [[WebSearch]].

An explanation of the table items follows.
