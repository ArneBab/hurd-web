GNOME can now be ported with the new [[Pthreads]], but is still being worked on.The packages are at

deb <http://people.debian.org/~mbanck/hurd-gnome/> ./

The caveats:

Some applications are not yet built, not even all the ones from gnome-core. 'apt-get install gnome-applets gnome-control-center gnome-icon-theme gnome-panel gnome-session metacity nautilus scrollkeeper' (along with the above APT source) should get you started.
