[Savannah](http://savannah.gnu.org) was created with a forked version of the software that runs the [SourceForge](http://www.sf.net) site. It is the official [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html) hosting facility of the [FSF](http://www.fsf.org). Many GNU projects are migrating to use it.
