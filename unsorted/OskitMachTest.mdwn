# <a name="Proposal_to_change_configure_scr"> </a> Proposal to change configure script for GNUmach 2.0

Here are my proposed changes to the GNU Mach 2.0 configure script, configure.in.

## <a name="_with_oskit_"> --with-oskit\* </a>

The first one is basically what Daniel Wagner once suggested. A way for builders to better provide the path of the OSKit, e.g., `--with-oskit=/my/bisarre/path`.

This patch also contains a minor "fix": detect presence of the OSKit before trying to check for a correct version number of the same. It also updates the required version number to be, at the very least, the 2001 release. This because we need the softirq changes introduced therein.

With the patch a configure line like below is entirely possible on a Debian system with the i386-gnu-mig deb package installed.

    crash@isengard:~/Projects/build/oskit-mach$ ../../oskit-mach/configure --host=i386-gnu \
                                                    --prefix=/usr/hurd --with-oskit=/usr/hurd

## <a name="Drivers_move_Makefile_gt_configu"> Drivers move Makefile ==&gt; configure </a>

The second patch set, currently worked on, is to move the requested drivers from the Makefile to the configure script in the form of `--enable-freebsd-DRIVER` and `--enable-linux-DRIVER`.

This will remove the current `make kernel-ide-ethernet_tulip` combo and introduce a more common `make kernel` scheme.
