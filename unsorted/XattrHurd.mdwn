Roland McGrath has made [Linux support for Hurd's extensions to ext2 via Extended Attributes (xattr) interface](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2004-02/msg00108.html). This is important because it allows Hurd to be completely cross-installed in Linux.

Michael Banck made some Debian precompiled Linux kernel packages that allow [using this xattr-hurd](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2004/09/msg00036.html).
