## <a name="What_do_you_mean_GNU_the_GNU_Hur"> </a> What do you mean "GNU", the GNU Hurd?

Yes and no. See <http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq.en.html#q1-2>

Latest version of this FAQ: [[Distrib/BochsFAQ]]

Latest GNU image for Bochs: [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group\_id=12580](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12580)

## <a name="Disk_line_for_bochsrc_"> Disk line for .bochsrc? </a>

for Bochs 2.0 or later:

        ata0-master: type=disk, path="gnu.img", cylinders=1024, heads=16, spt=63

for older versions:

        diskc: file="gnu.img", cyl=1024, heads=16, spt=63

## <a name="My_PATH_and_prompt_are_weird_and"> </a> My PATH and prompt are weird, and X clients fail

The profile is not loaded properly, do it manually with `". /etc/profile"`

## <a name="How_can_i_change_terminals_"> How can i change terminals? </a>

The Mach default console lack have multi-terminal capability, and up 'til recently we recommended the "screen" program. However, the new console server is installed and configured with 6 terminals. You can launch it with the ncursesw driver:

        console -d ncursesw /dev/vcs

Switching is done via `C-w 1` (or 2, 3, ...). you can exit it with `C-w x`

See the original posting to debian-hurd, <http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2002/debian-hurd-200209/msg00054.html>, or [[Hurd/HurdConsole]] for more details.

**_IMPORTANT:_** Note that X doesn't work well while running the console server.

## <a name="Does_X_work_"> Does X work? </a>

Somewhat:

* DRI and speedo modules won't load so they're deactivated.
* The VESA driver also failed so VGA is being used.
* more than 8 bpp won't work.
* for some weird reason the mouse server in `/dev/mouse` doesn't respond, so the mouse is inoperative.
* GNU is still an unstable OS which makes X crash often on it.

To reconfigure it, see Distrib.Xfree86, or:

        dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

then apply a patch to fix the mouse section:

        patch /etc/X11/XF86config-4 /root/XF86Config-4.diff

Installed clients are blackbox window manager and rxvt terminal emulator.

## <a name="Is_network_configured_"> Is network configured? </a>

Yes, to change parameters use:

        settrans -apfg /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet [options to pfinet]

See `/hurd/pfinet --help` for details, or the [[Hurd/GetNetworkRunning]] topic.

## <a name="How_do_i_mount_stuff_"> How do i mount stuff? </a>

        settrans -afg <node> /hurd/<translator> <options to translator>

Where `node` is your mount point and `translator` is the filesystem server. Add `-p` to settrans if you want it to stay over reboots (fstab-like)

## <a name="Anything_neat_to_try_"> Anything neat to try? </a>

Yes! instead of `"su"` use `"sush"`, a more flexible version that manages multiple UIDs.

You can also play with userspace filesystems for NFS and FTP in `/hurd/{nfs,ftpfs}` that you can run as user, debug with GDB, etc.
