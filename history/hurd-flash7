Subject: New Hurd Snapshot available

A new hurd snapshot is now available from
ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu/hurd-snap.tar.gz.

This snapshot contains many improvements over the last one, and is
also probably easier to compile.  

This snapshot must be used with the most recent libc snapshot,
ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu/libc-950411.tar.gz.  Previous versions
of the library will not work right.

If any files are discovered to be missing, please let me know asap.
