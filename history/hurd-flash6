A new Hurd snapshot has been placed on alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu.  There
may be unforseen problems with this snapshot, so the old one has been
left.  You may fetch this snapshot via anonymous FTP in the file
/gnu/hurd-snap.tar.gz.

The Hurd requires a modified version of MiG; you can get it by
anonymous ftp to kahlua.cs.utah.edu in /pub/mach/mach4-UK02p6.tar.gz.
Note that we are not yet using Mach4 for the Hurd, but we plan to
switch as soon as its feasible.

Other necessary software to run this snapshot include the latest
snapshot of binutils/ld/gas source from Cygnus and the latest GCC.
(Problems have been reported with GCC 2.6.1; you might want to wait
until 2.6.2 is released.)  And, of course, you also need the latest
test version of the GNU C Library, found on alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu.

This is not yet a real release; it is certainly not up to the quality
of even a hesitant alpha release.  But it may be useful for
educational value or to help with the Hurd effort.  

I will be out of town for most of the rest of the year; I will be
reading email but I may not be able to help with problems.  Sorry...
