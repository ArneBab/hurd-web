Subject:  hurd binary image


A filesystem image from a working hurd system, corresponding to the latest
snapshot, is available as:

  ftp://alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu/hurd-image-960418.tar.gz 

The whole tree takes about 37meg (warning -- it unpacks into `.').  Follow
the instructions in ./INSTALL-binary to make a working hurd system.

Due to a timely trashing of the disk on our main hurd machine, it has been
verified that it is possible to make a bootable hurd system from scratch
using this image and a set of netbsd 1.1 boot floppies...

The sources for the mach kernel included in the image are available in the
same directory as mach4-UK22.tar.gz and mach4-i386-UK22.tar.gz.
