[[!meta title=open_issue_porting]]

Here is a list of open issues in porting software to run on GNU/Hurd systems.
This list also includes [[hurd/toolchain]]-level items, items that are either
already solved in [[Debian GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] systems (tagged
*fixed_in_debian*) or being worked around, so if you're out for working on
application-level porting issues, then perusing through the list of [[Debian
packages that need porting|hurd/running/debian/porting]] may be better.
