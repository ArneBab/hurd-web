# 2009-07-27

Here's a log of a [Open POSIX Test Suite](http://posixtest.sourceforge.net/)
run (get sources, `make`, inspect `logfile`); this is from 2009-07-27 HEAD
sources on a 2009-07-27 Debian GNU/Hurd system.

The `logfile` has been post-processed with:

    $ sed ↩
        -e '/build: PASS$/d' ↩
        -e '/link: PASS$/d' ↩
        -e '/link: SKIP$/d' ↩
        -e '/execution: PASS$/d'

The tests that failed as *INTERRUPTED* were hanging and have manually been
interrupted using `kill [PID]`.

    <pinotree> [...] saw posixtestsuite being completed too \o/
    <youpi> yep :)
    <pinotree> (still has a number of failures, but at least can be fully run)
