    <braunr> omg the ugliness
    <braunr> the number of pages in physical memory for on object is a short
      ... which limits the amount to .. 128 MiB
    * braunr cries
    <braunr> luckily, this should be easy to solve

`vm/vm_object.h:vm_object:resident_page_count`.

    <elmig>
      http://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/open_issues/gnumach_vm_object_resident_page_count/
    <elmig> this is a int
    <elmig> how to deal with the page? delete it? archive it?
    <braunr> ?
    <elmig> the issue originallu reported was fixed, right?
    <braunr> i think so, yes
    <braunr> for now at least
    <elmig> so this stays on the open_issues on the wiki anyway?
    <braunr> no, it should go away
    <elmig> i dont know how to suggest deletion on the wiki
    <braunr> don't
    <braunr> i'll do it later
