*Performance analysis* ([[!wikipedia Performance_analysis desc="Wikipedia
article"]]) deals with analyzing how computing resources are used for
completing a specified task.

[[Profiling]] is one relevant tool.

In [[microkernel]]-based systems, there is generally a considerable [[RPC]]
overhead.

In a multi-server system, it is non-trivial to implement a high-performance
[[I/O System|community/gsoc/project_ideas/disk_io_performance]].

When providing [[faq/POSIX_compatibility]] (and similar interfaces) in an
environemnt that doesn't natively implement these interfaces, there may be a
severe performance degradation.  For example, in this [[`fork` system
call|/glibc/fork]]'s case.

[[Unit_testing]] can be used for tracking performance regressions.

    <braunr> the more i study the code, the more i think a lot of time is
      wasted on cpu, unlike the common belief of the lack of performance being
      only due to I/O
