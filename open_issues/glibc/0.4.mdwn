In context of [[packaging_libpthread]]/[[libpthread]].

    <pinotree> once libc is switched internally from cthreads to pthreads (thus
      breaking its BC), may be worth cleanup the hurd-specific exported symbols
    <tschwinge> pinotree: Yes.  If you already have ideas about what to clean
      up, feel free to add a new page or a section on open_issues/glibc.
    <pochu> we're gonna break backwards compatibility in glibc on hurd? that
      could be the perfect moment to fix the /dev/fd/N problem without adding
      new RPCs, though we'd probably have to break backwards-compatibility in
      the exec server IIRC...
    <tschwinge> pochu: Oh, I have to re-read that discussion, but thanks for
      reminding!
    <tschwinge> pochu: Won't happen today or tomorrow, but "sometime".
