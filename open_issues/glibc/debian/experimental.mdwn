    <markus_w1nner> I have a strange tcp via localhost question:
    <markus_wanner> The other side closes the connection, but I haven't read
      all data, yet. I should still be able to read the pending data, no?
    <markus_wanner> At least it seems to work that way on Linux, but not on
      Hurd.
    <markus_wanner> Got a simple repro with nc, if you're interested...
    <youpi> markus_wanner: yes, we're interested
    <markus_wanner> youpi: okay, here we go:
    <markus_wanner> session 1: nc -l -p 7777 localhost
    <markus_wanner> session 2: nc 127.0.0.1 7777
    <markus_wanner> session 2: a <RET> b <RET> c <RET>
    <markus_wanner> session 1: [ pause with Ctrl-Z ]
    <markus_wanner> session 2: [ send more data ] d <RET> e <RET> f <RET>
    <markus_wanner> session 2: [ quit with Ctrl-C ]
    <markus_wanner> session 1: [ resume with 'fg' ]
    <markus_wanner> The server on session 1 doesn't get the data sent after it
      paused and before the client closed the connection.
    <markus_wanner> I'm not sure if that's a valid TCP thing. However, on
      Linux, the server still gets the data. On hurd it doesn't.
    <markus_wanner> I'm working on a C-code test case, ATM.
    <youpi> markus_wanner: on which box are you seeing this behavior?
    <youpi> exodar does not have it
    <youpi> i.e. I do get the d e f
    <markus_wanner> a private VM (I'm not a DD)
    <markus_wanner> ..updated to latest experimental stuff.
    <markus_wanner> GNU lematur 0.3 GNU-Mach 1.3.99-486/Hurd-0.3 i686-AT386 GNU
    <youpi> ok, I can't reproduce it on my vm either
    <youpi> maybe the C program will help
    <markus_wanner> Hm.. cannot corrently reproduce that in C. (Netcat still
      shows the issue, though).
    <markus_wanner> I'll try to strace netcat...
    <markus_wanner> ..Meh. strace not available on Hurd?
    <pinotree> no, but there is rpctrace to show the various rpc
    <markus_wanner> Cool, looks helpful.
    <markus_wanner> Thx
    <markus_wanner> Uh.. that introduces another error:
    <markus_wanner> rpctrace: ../../utils/rpctrace.c:1287: trace_and_forward:
      Assertion `reply_type == 18' failed.

[[hurd/debugging/rpctrace]].

    <youpi> I'm checking on a box without ipv6 configuration
    <youpi> maybe that's the difference between you and me
    <youpi> I guess your /etc/alternatives/nc is /bin/nc.traditional ?
    <markus_wanner> Yup, nc.traditional.
    <markus_wanner> Looks like that box only has IPv4 configured.
    <markus_wanner> Something very strange is going on here. No matter how hard
      I try, I cannot reproduce this with netcat, anymore.
    <pinotree> not even after a reboot?
    <markus_wanner> Woo.. here, it happened, again! This is driving me crazy!
    <markus_wanner> Now, nc seemingly connects, but is unable to send data
      between the two. Netcat would somehow complain, if it failed to connect,
      no?
    <markus_wanner> No it worked.
    <markus_wanner> So this seems to be an intermittent issue. So far, I could
      only ever repro it as a normal user, not as root. May be coincidental,
      though.
    <markus_wanner> Now, 'a' and 'b' made it through, but not the 'c' sent
      manually just after that. Something with that TCP/IP stack is definitely
      fishy.
    <markus_wanner> Anything I can try to investigate? Or shall I simply
      restart and see if the problem persists?
    <youpi> maybe restart, yes
    <youpi> did you restart since the upgrade ?
    <markus_wanner> Yes, I restarted after that.
    <markus_wanner> Hm.. okay, restarted. Some problem persists.
    <markus_wanner> I currently have two netcat processes connected, the
      listening one got some first two messages and seems stuck now.
    <markus_wanner> With the client, I tried to send more data, but the server
      doesn't get it, anymore.
    <markus_wanner> Any idea on what I can do to analyze the situation?
    <youpi> for the netcat issue, I haven't experienced this
    <youpi> are you running in kvm or virtualbox or something else?
    <markus_wanner> I'm currently puzzled about what "experimental" actually
      ships.
    <markus_wanner> On kvm.
    <markus_wanner> My libc0.3 used to be 2.13-39+hurd.3.
    <markus_wanner> But packages.d.o already shows 2.17.0experimental2.
    <youpi> experimental ships experimental versions, which you aren't supposed
      to use
    <youpi> unless you know what you are doing
    <youpi> iirc 2.17 is known to be quite broken for now
    <markus_wanner> Okay. So I guess I'll try to "downgrade" to unstable, then.
    <markus_wanner> Phew, okay, successfully downgraded to unstable.
    <markus_wanner> Hopefully monotone's test suite runs through fine, now.
    <markus_wanner> Yup, WORKING! Looks like some experimental packages caused
      the problem. The netcat test as well as that one failing monotone test
      work fine, now.

    <tschwinge> pinotree, youpi: Is there anything from that markus_wanner
      discussion about pfinet/netcat/signals that needs to be filed?  I guess
      we don't know what exactly he changed so that everything workedd fine
      eventually?  (Some experimental package(s), but which?)
    <youpi> that was libc0.3 packages
    <youpi> which are indeed known to break the network
