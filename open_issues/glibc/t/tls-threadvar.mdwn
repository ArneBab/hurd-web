[[!tag open_issue_glibc open_issue_libpthread]]

This basically means to get rid of `sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/libc-tsd.h` (and
thus the `_HURD_THREADVAR_*`/`_hurd_threadvar_location` interface), and
directly use `__thread` instead.

IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-10-23:

    <tschwinge> youpi: If we want to replace threadvars with TLS, there is one
      problem: the threadvars interface is publically exported:
      /usr/include/hurd/threadvar.h.
    <tschwinge> youpi: But I am somewhat inclined to say that the only user of
      this is libthreads/libpthread.  Do you think differently?
    <youpi> tschwinge: that's very probable
    <youpi> so I think we can just drop it
    <youpi> (people should use TLS anyway)

[[libpthread_set_stack_size]].

After this has been done, probably the whole `__libc_tsd_*` stuff can be
dropped altogether, and `__thread` directly be used in glibc.
