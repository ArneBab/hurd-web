IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-10-23:

    <tschwinge> youpi: If we want to replace threadvars with TLS, there is one
      problem: the threadvars interface is publically exported:
      /usr/include/hurd/threadvar.h.
    <tschwinge> youpi: But I am somewhat inclined to say that the only user of
      this is libthreads/libpthread.  Do you think differently?
    <youpi> tschwinge: that's very probable
    <youpi> so I think we can just drop it
    <youpi> (people should use TLS anyway)
