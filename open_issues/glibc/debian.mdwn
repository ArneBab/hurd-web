# Open Issues

`threads = yes` is set in `debian/sysdeps/linux.mk` and
`debian/sysdeps/kfreebsd.mk`, `debian/sysdeps/hurd.mk` set to `no`.  But this
is only read in `debian/rules` for deciding some `nscd` package issue?

`debian/sysdeps/hurd.mk`'s `libc_extra_install` for `ld.so`: check with GCC
configuration.

Could add a toggle to `$(stamp)build_%` in `debian/rules.d/build.mk` to skip
locale stuff.

`--disable-compatible-utmp`?


# Building

Run `debian/rules patch` to apply patches (instead of having it done during the
build).  Then you can edit files manually.

Several passes: `libc`, `i686`, `xen`; `EGLIBC_PASSES='libc i686'`, etc.

If building with `EGLIBC_PASSES=libc` (more specifically, without `xen`), the
`libc0.3-dev_extra_pkg_install` rule in `debian/sysdeps/hurd-i386.mk` will
fail.  (Same for `libc6-dev_extra_pkg_install` in `debian/sysdeps/i386.mk`, for
example.)  Why is this special handling only done for `xen`, but not for
`i686`?

> Samuel: Historically because it's done that way in linux-i386. I don't know

Do `export LC_ALL=C` before building, otherwise the testsuite/make error
messages will be different from those stored in the
`debian/testsuite-checking/expected-results-*` files, resulting in a spurious
build failure.

Run `debian/rules build-arch DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=2 [EGLIBC_PASSES=...]`
to build (or `build` instead of `build-arch` to build the arch-independent
stuff, too).  Can interrupt with `C-c` during locale stuff or testsuite if only
interested in the build tree.

Run `fakeroot debian/rules binary DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=2
[EGLIBC_PASSES=...]` to build Debian packages or `binary-arch` for just the
architecture-dependent ones.

The latter two steps can also be combined as `dpkg-buildpackage -R'debian/rules
EGLIBC_PASSES=libc' -nc -b -uc`.  `-nc` will prevent the *clean step* which
would first try to un-patch, which may conflict if you have done any edits
apter applying patches.

If the Debian symbol versioning file is not up to date and the build of Debian
packages fails due to this, putting `DPKG_GENSYMBOLS_CHECK_LEVEL=0` in the
environment \`\`helps''; see `man dpkg-gensymbols`.
