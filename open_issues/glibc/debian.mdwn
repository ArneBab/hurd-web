# Open Issues

`threads = yes` is set in `debian/sysdeps/linux.mk` and
`debian/sysdeps/kfreebsd.mk`, `debian/sysdeps/hurd.mk` set to `no`.  But this
is only read in `debian/rules` for deciding some `nscd` package issue?

`debian/sysdeps/hurd.mk`'s `libc_extra_install` for `ld.so`: check with GCC
configuration.

Could add a toggle to `$(stamp)build_%` in `debian/rules.d/build.mk` to skip
locale stuff.

`--disable-compatible-utmp`?


# Building

Run `debian/rules patch` to apply patches (instead of having it done during the
build).  Then you can edit files manually.

Several passes: `libc`, `i686`, `xen`; `EGLIBC_PASSES='libc i686'`, etc.

If building with `EGLIBC_PASSES=libc` (more specifically, without `xen`), the
`libc0.3-dev_extra_pkg_install` rule in `debian/sysdeps/hurd-i386.mk` will
fail.  (Same for `libc6-dev_extra_pkg_install` in `debian/sysdeps/i386.mk`, for
example.)  Why is this special handling only done for `xen`, but not for
`i686`?

Do `export LC_ALL=C` before building, otherwise the testsuite/make error
messages will be different from those stored in the
`debian/testsuite-checking/expected-results-*` files.

Run `debian/rules build-arch DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=2 [EGLIBC_PASSES=...]`.
Can stop with `C-c` during locale stuff or testsuite if only interested in the
build tree.
