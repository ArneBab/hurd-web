    < zyg> did the segment registers had any purpose? I see fs is set equal to
      others, but on linux fs is 0 (atleast on this x86 box).
    < braunr> zyg: it can be used by special applications like wine, yes
    < zyg> braunr: thanks.. I'm reading up on linux actually. It seems gs can
      be used for TLS, fs in syscall to pass userspace.
    < braunr> zyg: why are you interested in that ?
    < zyg> a native compiler under linux places assumptions on fs register. So
      I'm trying to find out what it should do under gnumach/hurd.
    < braunr> what compiler ?
    < zyg> braunr: it's sbcl
    < braunr> ok
    < youpi> zyg: the same, basically
    < zyg> ok.. looking at the code, I've remarked where it sets up FS, because
      /usr/include/asm/ldt.h:struct user_desc is missing. I must search for the
      equiv.
    < youpi> zyg: mach/i386/mach_i386.h
    < youpi> the descriptor structure
