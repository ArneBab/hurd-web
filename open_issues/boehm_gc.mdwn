Here's what's to be done for maintaining Boehm GC.

This one does need Hurd-specific configuration.

It is, for example, used by [[/GCC]] (which has its own fork), so any changes
committed upstream should very like also be made there.

01d2509c13f3aa7e03cb4cbf50fda08f98725ce4 (2016-03-24).

  * `configure.ac`

      * `PARALLEL_MARK` is not enabled; doesn't make sense so far.

      * `*-*-kfreebsd*-gnu` defines `USE_COMPILER_TLS`.  What's this, and
        why does not other config?

  * `configure.host`

    Nothing.

  * `Makefile.am`, `include/include.am`, `cord/cord.am`, `doc/doc.am`,
    `tests/tests.am`

    Nothing.

  * `include/gc_config_macros.h`

    Should be OK.

  * `include/private/gcconfig.h`

    Hairy.  But should be OK.  Search for *HURD*, compare to *LINUX*,
    *I386* case.

    See `doc/porting.html` and `doc/README.macros` (and others) for
    documentation.

    *LINUX* has:

      * `#define LINUX_STACKBOTTOM`

        Defined instead of `STACKBOTTOM` to have the value read from `/proc/`.

      * `#define HEAP_START (ptr_t)0x1000`

        May want to define it for us, too?

      * `#ifdef USE_I686_PREFETCH`, `USE_3DNOW_PREFETCH` --- [...]

        Apparently these are optimization that we also could use.  Have a
        look at *LINUX* for *X86_64*, which uses `__builtin_prefetch`
        (which Linux x86 could use, too?).

            # define NO_GETCONTEXT
            #endif

        Also see comment below, regarding `mach_dep.c`.

    *HURD* has:

      * `#define STACK_GROWS_DOWN`

      * `#define HEURISTIC2`

        Defined instead of `STACKBOTTOM` to have the value probed.

        Linux also has this:

            #if defined(LINUX_STACKBOTTOM) && defined(NO_PROC_STAT) \
                && !defined(USE_LIBC_PRIVATES)
                /* This combination will fail, since we have no way to get  */
                /* the stack base.  Use HEURISTIC2 instead.                 */
            #   undef LINUX_STACKBOTTOM
            #   define HEURISTIC2
                /* This may still fail on some architectures like IA64.     */
                /* We tried ...                                             */
            #endif

        Being on [[glibc]], we could perhaps do similar as `USE_LIBC_PRIVATES`
        instead of `HEURISTIC2`.  Pro: avoid `SIGSEGV` (and general fragility)
        during probing at startup (if I'm understanding this correctly).  Con:
        rely on glibc internals.  Or we instead add support to parse
        [[`/proc/`|hurd/translator/procfs]] (can even use the same as Linux?),
        or use some other interface.  [[!tag open_issue_glibc]]
        This is also likely the issue causing the GDB [[!tag open_issue_gdb]]
        `GC_find_limit_with_bound` SIGSEGV startup confusion described in
        [[binutils]].

      * `#define SIG_SUSPEND SIGUSR1`, `#define SIG_THR_RESTART SIGUSR2`

      * We don't `#define MPROTECT_VDB` (WIP comment); but Linux neither.

      * Where does our `GETPAGESIZE` come from?  Should we `#include
        <unistd.h>` like it is done for *LINUX*?

  * `include/gc_pthread_redirects.h`

      * TODO

        Cancellation stuff is Linux-only.  In other places, too.

  * `mach_dep.c`

      * `#define NO_GETCONTEXT`

        [[!taglink open_issue_glibc]], but this is not a real problem here,
        because we can use the following GCC internal function without much
        overhead:
        [TODO] (?)

        Also see comment above, regarding `include/private/gcconfig.h`.

  * `dyn_load.c`

# Build

Here's a log of a boehm-gc build run; this is from Git commit
d6c34577eeaba37ff08998d18676531082c040b6 (2016-03-18), and for `libatomic_ops`
Git commit 01d2509c13f3aa7e03cb4cbf50fda08f98725ce4 (2016-03-24), run on
kepler.SCHWINGE and laplace.SCHWINGE.

    $ export LC_ALL=C
    $ (cd ../master/ && ln -sfn ../libatomic_ops/master libatomic_ops)
    $ (cd ../master/ && autoreconf -vfi)
    $ ../master/configure --prefix="$PWD".install SHELL=/bin/bash CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 --enable-cplusplus --enable-gc-debug --enable-gc-assertions --enable-assertions 2>&1 | tee log_build
    [...]
    $ make 2>&1 | tee log_build_
    [...]

Different hosts may default to different shells and compiler versions; thus
harmonized.  Using bash instead of dash as otherwise libtool explodes.

  * only GNU/Linux: `configure: WARNING: "Explicit GC_INIT() calls may be
    required."`

    -fomit-frame-pointer."`


# Install

    $ (cd libatomic_ops/ && make -k check) 2>&1 | tee log_test_
    [...]


## Analysis

    $ toolchain/logs/process boehm-gc test

There are different configurations possible, but in general, the testsuite
restults of GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd look very similar.

  * GNU/Hurd is missing `Call chain at allocation: [...]` output.

    `os_dep.c`:`GC_print_callers`


# TODO

  * What are other applications to test Boehm GC?  Also especially in
    combination with [[/libpthread]] and dynamic loading of shared libraries?

      * There are patches (apparently not committed) that GCC itself can use
        it, too: <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_tuning>.

      * There's been some talking about it on GNU guile mailing lists, and two
        Git branches (2010-12-15: last change 2009-09).

    <pinotree> youpi: i think i found out the possible cause of the ecl and
      mono issuess
    <pinotree> -s
    <youpi> oh
    <pinotree> basically, we don't have the realtime signals (so no
      SIGRTMIN/SIGRTMAX defined), hence things use either SIGUSR1 or
      SIGUSR2... which are used in libgc to resp. stop/resume threads when
      "collecting"
    <pinotree> i just patched ecl to use SIGINFO instead of SIGUSR1 (used when
      no SIGRTMIN+2 is available), and it seems going on for a while
    <youpi> uh, why would SIGINFO work better than SIGUSR1?
    <pinotree> it was a test, i tried the first "not common" signal i saw
    <pinotree> my test was, use any signal different than USR1/2
    <youpi> ah, sorry, I hadn't understood
    <youpi> you mean there's a conflict between ecl and mono using SIGUSR1, as
      well as libgc?
    <pinotree> yes
    <pinotree> for example, in ecl sources see src/c/unixint.d,
      install_process_interrupt_handler()
    <youpi> SIGINFO seems a sane choice
    <youpi> SIGPWR could have been a better choice if it was available :)
    <pinotree> i would have chose an "unassigned" number, say SIGLOST (the
      bigger one) + 10, but it would be greater than _NSIG (and thus discarded)
    <youpi> not a good idea indeed
    <pinotree> it seems that linux, beside the range for rt signals, has some
      "free space"
    <pinotree> i'll start now another ecl build, from scratch this time, with
      s/SIGUSR1/SIGINFO/ (making sure ctags won't bother), and if it works i'll
      update svante's bug

    <pinotree> mmap(...PROT_NONE...) failed
    <pinotree> hmm...
    <pinotree> apparently enabling MMAP_ANON in mono's libgc copy was a good
      step, let's see


### IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2012-03-18

    <pinotree> youpi: mono is afflicted by the SIGUSR1/2 conflict with libgc
    <youpi> pinotree: didn't we have a solution for that?
    <pinotree> well, it works just for one signal
    <pinotree> the ideal solution would be having a range for RT signals, and
      make libgc use RTMIN+5/6, like done on most of other OSes
    <youpi> but we don't have RT signals, do we?
    <pinotree> right :(


### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-03-21

    <pinotree> civodul: given we have to realtime signals (so no range of
      signals for them), libgc uses SIGUSR1/2 instead of using SIGRTMIN+5/6 for
      its thread synchronization stuff
    <pinotree> civodul: which means that if an application using libgc then
      sets its own handlers for either of SIGUSR1/2, hell breaks
    <civodul> pinotree: ok
    <civodul> pinotree: is it a Debian-specific change, or included upstream?
    <pinotree> libgc using SIGUSR1/2? upstream
    <civodul> ok


### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-03

    <congzhang> braunr: when will libc malloc say memory corruption?
    <braunr> congzhang: usually on free
    <braunr> sometimes on alloc
    <congzhang> and after one thread be created
    <congzhang> I want to know why and how to find the source
    <congzhang> does libgc work well on hurd?
    <braunr> i don't think it does
    <congzhang> so , why it can't?
    <braunr> congzhang: what ?
    <congzhang> libgc was not work on hurd
    <pinotree> why?
    <congzhang> I try porting dotgnu
    <braunr> ah
    <braunr> nested signal handling
    <congzhang> one program always receive Abort signal
    <pinotree> and why it should be a problem in libgc?
    <congzhang> for malloc memory corruption
    <braunr> libgc relies on this
    <congzhang> yes
    <congzhang> so, is there a workaround to make it work? 
    <braunr> show the error please
    <congzhang> http://paste.debian.net/34416/
    <pinotree> where's libgc?
    <congzhang> i compile dotgnu with enable-gc
    <pinotree> so?
    <congzhang> I am not sure about it
    <pinotree> so why did you say earlier that libgc doesn't work?
    <congzhang> because after I see one thread was created notice by gdb, it
      memory corruption
    <pinotree> so what?
    <congzhang> maybe gabage collection happen, and gc thread start
    <pinotree> that's speculation
    <pinotree> you cannot debug things speculating on code you don't know
    <pinotree> less speculation and more in-deep debugging, please
    * congzhang I try again, to check weather thread list changing
    <congzhang> sorry for this
    <braunr> it simply looks like a real memory corruption (an overflow)
    <congzhang> maybe PATH related problem
    <pinotree> PATH?
    <congzhang> yes
    <braunr> PATH_MAX
    <braunr> but unlikely
    <congzhang> csant do path traverse
    <congzhang> I fond the macro
    <congzhang> found
    <congzhang> #if defined(__sun__) || defined(__BEOS__)
    <congzhang> #define     BROKEN_DIRENT   1
    <congzhang> #endif
    <congzhang> and so for hurd?
    <pinotree> BROKEN_DIRENT doesn't say much about what it does
    <WhiteKIBA> nope
    <WhiteKIBA> whoops
    <congzhang> it seems other port meet the trouble too
    <pinotree> which trouble?
    <congzhang> http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.dotgnu.developer/3642
    <congzhang> (gdb) ptype struct dirent
    <congzhang> type = struct dirent {
    <congzhang>     __ino_t d_ino;
    <congzhang>     unsigned short d_reclen;
    <congzhang>     unsigned char d_type;
    <congzhang>     unsigned char d_namlen;
    <congzhang>     char d_name[1];
    <congzhang> }
    <congzhang>  
    <congzhang> d_name should be char[PATH_MAX]?
    <congzhang> and
      http://libjit-linear-scan-register-allocator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pnet/support/dir.c
    <pinotree> no
    <braunr> stop pasting that much
    <_d3f> uhm PATH_MAX on the hurd?
    <braunr> and stop saying nonsense
    <congzhang> sorry, i think four line was not worth to pastbin 
    <pinotree> they are 8
    <congzhang> never again
    <braunr> just try by defining BROKEN_DIRENT to 1 in all cases and see how
      it goes
    * congzhang read dir.c again
    <congzhang> braunr: it does not crash this time, I do more test


#### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-04

    <congzhang> hi, I am dotgnu work on hurd, and even winforms app 
    <congzhang> s/am/make
    <congzhang> and maybe c# hello world translate another day :)


### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-16

    <braunr> gnu_srs: ah, libgc
    <braunr> there are signal-related problems with libgc


## Leak Detection

### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-17

    <teythoon> I spent the last two days integrating libgc - the boehm
      conservative garbage collector - into hurd
    <teythoon> it can be used in leak detection mode
    <azeem> whoa, cool
    <teythoon> and it actually kind of works, finds malloc leaks in translators
    <braunr> i think there were problems with signal handling in libgc
    <braunr> i'm not sure we support nested signal handling well
    <teythoon> yes, I read about them
    <teythoon> libgc uses SIGUSR1/2, so any program installing handlers on them
      will break
    <azeem> (which is not a problem on Linux, cause there some RT-signals or so
      are used)
    <teythoon> yes
