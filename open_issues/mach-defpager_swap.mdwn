# IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2012-06-16

    <lifeng> I allocated a 5GB partition as swap, but hurd only found 1GB
    <youpi> use 2GiB swaps only, >2Gib are not supported
    <youpi> (and apparently it just truncates the size, to be investigated)

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-25

    <C-Keen> mkswap truncated the swap partiton to 2GB
    <teythoon> :/
    <teythoon> have you checked with 'free' ?
    <teythoon> I have a 4gb swap partition on one of my boxes
    <C-Keen> how did you create it?
    <C-Keen> 2gig swap alright
    <C-Keen> according to free


# Swap Files

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-25

    <braunr> C-Keen: swapfiles are not to work very badly on the hurd
    <braunr> swapfiles cause recursion and reservation problems on every system
      but on the hurd, we just never took the time to fix the swap code

Same issues as we generally would have with `hurd-defpager`?
