    <slpz> It's amazing how broken some parts of Mach's VM are
    <slpz> currently, it doesn't even keep track of the number of external
      pages in the lists
    <slpz> and vm_pageout_scan produces a hang if want_pages == FALSE (which
      never is, because vm_page_external_count is always 0)
