    <mcsim> hello. Is there any way to debug mach-defpager? When I set
      breakpoint to any function in it, pager never breaks.

IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-11-11:

    <mcsim> hello. I've read that hde tried to debug defpager and wrote some
      patches for debugging defpager,  but I couldn't find them. Does anybody
      know are these patches in public?
