    <braunr> teythoon: can you stop tmux on darnassus please ?
    <braunr> i'd like to check something
    <teythoon> done
    <braunr> tmux makes load average grow to 5 without any visible activity :/
    <braunr> can't reproduce it with my instances though
    <braunr> anyway, that's minor
    <teythoon> I used tmux before and never encountered that
    <teythoon> sometimes tmux would hang on attaching or detaching though, but
      overall I had less problems with tmux than with screen
    <teythoon> ah, I tried to start tmux on darnassus and now it hangs

    <teythoon> braunr: whoa, i can reproduce gnu_srs' hanging ssh sessions on
      darnassus
    <teythoon> here goes
    <teythoon> run tmux, exit the shell so that tmux quits, start tmux again
      (tmux hangs now on some socket stuff), log in with ssh again, pkill tmux,
      rm /tmp/tmux*/default => both ssh sessions hang and time out eventually
    <braunr> why start tmux twice ?
    <teythoon> dunno
    <teythoon> that's what i just did, twice in a row
    <teythoon> there's a bug somewhere that makes tmux hang if the socket
      exists but no tmux server is running
    <teythoon> maybe that contributes to to the other issuse, i don't know
    <braunr> looks like an infinite loop somewhere
    <gnu_srs> teythoon: Nice to set that I'm not alone having this problem:P
    <braunr> teythoon: what's happening ? :)
    <teythoon> ?
    <braunr> on darnassus
    <teythoon> not sure
    <teythoon> uh, something is very wrong o_O
    <teythoon> help ?
    <braunr> :)
    <braunr> the msg thread of a process is blocked somewhere
    <braunr> preventing ps/top from completing
    <braunr> looks like proc is blocked now ..
    <braunr> restarting the vm
    <braunr> apparently, removing buggy tmux sockets make pflocal crash
    <braunr> thanks for the report :)
    <teythoon> you are welcome :)
