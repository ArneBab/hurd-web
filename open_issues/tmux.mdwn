    <braunr> teythoon: can you stop tmux on darnassus please ?
    <braunr> i'd like to check something
    <teythoon> done
    <braunr> tmux makes load average grow to 5 without any visible activity :/
    <braunr> can't reproduce it with my instances though
    <braunr> anyway, that's minor
    <teythoon> I used tmux before and never encountered that
    <teythoon> sometimes tmux would hang on attaching or detaching though, but
      overall I had less problems with tmux than with screen
    <teythoon> ah, I tried to start tmux on darnassus and now it hangs
