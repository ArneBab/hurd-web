    <mcsim> hi. do I understand correct that following is true: vm_object_t a;
      a->shadow->copy == a;?
    <braunr> mcsim: not completely sure, but i'd say no
    <braunr> but mach terminology isn't always firm, so possible
    <braunr> mcsim: apparently you're right, although be careful that it may
      not be the case *all* the time
    <braunr> there may be inconsistent states
