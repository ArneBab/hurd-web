[[!tag open_issue_gdb]]

GDB's `gcore` command doesn't work / needs to be implemented / ported in GDB:

    tschwinge@flubber:~ $ gcore 8371
    [New Thread 8371.1]
    [New Thread 8371.2]
    [New Thread 8371.3]
    /media/data/home/tschwinge/core.cA0ICY:2: Error in sourced command file:
    Undefined command: "gcore".  Try "help".
    gcore: failed to create core.8371

If someone is working in this area, they may want to port
<http://code.google.com/p/google-coredumper/>, too.
