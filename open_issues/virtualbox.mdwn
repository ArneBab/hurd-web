Running GNU Mach in VirtualBox crashes during initialization.

IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-08-15

    <BlueT_> HowTo Reproduce: 1) Use `reboot` to reboot the system.  2) Once you see the Grub menu, turn off the debian hurd box.  3) Let the box boot normally, and wait for the error/crash/reboot. 4) The error/crash will happen twice and it's reboot automatically. The 3rd boot will success.

    <BlueT_> root@dhurd:/boot# addr2line -f -e gnumach-1.3.99-486-dbg-copy 0x106c93 0x1556a5 0x152c54

    <BlueT_> /home/buildd/build/chroot-sid/home/buildd/byhand/gnumach/build-dbg/../kern/bootstrap.c:756

    i386/i386/locore.S:1289 is 

        movl    $USER_DS,%eax           /* use user data segment for accesses */
=>      mov     %ax,%es

    <youpi> oh, wait, it's not even the data access which poses problem
    <youpi> but the use of $USER_DS
    <youpi> ew
    <youpi> looks like a gdt initialization emulation issue in virtualbox...


    <BlueT_> just found that at the second crash, the address is different
    <BlueT_> 2nd time:
    <BlueT_> addr2line -f -e gnumach-1.3.99-486-dbg-copy 0x1068bd 0x152c74

    <BlueT_> user_bootstrap
    <BlueT_> /home/buildd/build/chroot-sid/home/buildd/byhand/gnumach/build-dbg/../kern/bootstrap.c:765

    i386/i386/locore.S:527 is:

_return_from_kernel:
_kret_popl_gs:
        popl    %gs                     /* restore segment registers */
_kret_popl_fs:
        popl    %fs
_kret_popl_es:
=>      popl    %es
_kret_popl_ds:

    <youpi> looks again like a $USER_DS issue
    <youpi> what's interesting is that that one means that $USER_DS did load in %es fine at least once 
    <youpi> and it's the reload that fails
