# State as of 2011-03-06

freenode, #hurd channel, 2011-03-06:

    <pinotree> tschwinge: (speaking on working perl, how did it en with that
      "(glibc) double free" crash with perl?)
    <pinotree> *end
    <tschwinge> I think I remember I suspected it's a libgomp (!) issue in the
      end.  I have not yet continued working on that.
    <pinotree> libogmp? looks like you know more than me, then :)
    <youpi> tschwinge: oh, I'm interested
    <youpi> I know a bit about libgomp :)
    <tschwinge> I bisected this down to where Imagemagick added -fgomp (or
      whatever it is).  And then the perl library (Imagemagick.pm?) which loads
      the imagemagick.so segfaulted.
    <tschwinge> ImageMagick did this change in the middle of a x.x.x.something
      release..
    <tschwinge> My next step would have been to test whether libgomp works at
      all for us.
    <youpi> ./usr/sbin/debootstrap:DEBOOTSTRAP_CHECKSUM_FIELD="SHA$SHA_SIZE"
    <youpi> erf
    <youpi> so they switched to another checksum
    <youpi> but we don't have that one on all of our packages :)
    <youpi> tschwinge: 
    <youpi> buildd@bach:~$ OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./test
    <youpi> I'm 0x1
    <youpi> I'm 0x3
    <youpi> libgomp works at least a bit
    <tschwinge> OK.
    <pinotree> i guess we should hope the working bits don't stop at that point
      ;)
    <tschwinge> If open_issues/perlmagick is to be believed a diff of 6.4.1-1
      and 6.4.1-2 should tell what exactly was changed.
    <tschwinge> Oh!
    <tschwinge> I even have it on the page already!  ;-)
    <tschwinge> -fopenmp
    <youpi> I've tried the pragmas that imagemagick uses
    <youpi> they work
    <tschwinge> Might be the issue fixed itself?
    <youpi> I don't know, it's the latest libc here
    <youpi> (and latest hurd, to be uploaded)
