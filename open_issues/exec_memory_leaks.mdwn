There are is some memory leak in [[`exec`|hurd/translator/exec]].  After twelve
hours worth of `fork/exec` ([[GCC]]'s `check-c` part of the testsuite), we got:

      PID  UID  PPID  PGrp  Sess TH  Vmem   RSS %CPU     User   System Args
        4    0     3     1     1 10  392M  262M  0.0  2:18.29     2hrs /hurd/exec

The *RSS* seems a tad high.  Also the system part of CPU time consumption is
quite noticeable.  In comparison:
