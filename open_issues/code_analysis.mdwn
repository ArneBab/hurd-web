    the realloc issues are for real*).

        <vsrinivas> two things you can do -- there is an environment variable
          (DEBUG_MALLOC_ iirc?) that can be set to 2 to make ptmalloc (glibc's
          allocator) more forceful and verbose wrt error checking
        <vsrinivas> another is to grab a copy of Tor's source tree and copy out
          OpenBSD's allocator (its a clearly-identifyable file in the tree);
          LD_PRELOAD it or link it into your app, it is even more aggressive
          about detecting memory misuse.
        <vsrinivas> third, Red hat has a gdb python plugin that can instrument
          glibc's heap structure. its kinda handy, might help?
        <vsrinivas> MALLOC_CHECK_ was the envvar you want, sorry.
