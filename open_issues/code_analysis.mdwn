In the topic of *code analysis* or *program analysis* ([[!wikipedia
Program_analysis_(computer_science) desc="Wikipedia article"]]), there is
static code analysis ([[!wikipedia Static_code_analysis desc="Wikipedia
article"]]) and dynamic program analysis ([[!wikipedia Dynamic_program_analysis
desc="Wikipedia article"]]).  This topic overlaps with [[performance
analysis|performance]], [[formal_verification]], as well as general
[[debugging]].

# Bounty

There is a [[!FF_project 276]][[!tag bounty]] on some of these tasks.


# Static

  * [[GCC]]'s warnings.  Yes, really.

      * GCC plugins can be used for additional semantic analysis.  For example,
        <http://lwn.net/Articles/457543/>, and search for *kernel context* in
        the comments.

      * Have GCC make use of [[RPC]]/[[microkernel/mach/MIG]] *in*/*out*
        specifiers, and have it emit useful warnings in case these are pointing
        to uninitialized data (for *in* only).

  * [[Port Sequence Numbers|microkernel/mach/ipc/sequence_numbering]].  If
    these are used, care must be taken to update them reliably, [[!message-id
    "1123688017.3905.22.camel@buko.sinrega.org"]].  This could be checked by a
    static analysis tool.

  * [[!wikipedia List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis]]

  * [Cppcheck](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppcheck/)

    For example, [Debian's hurd_20110319-2
    package](http://qa.debian.org/daca/cppcheck/sid/hurd_20110319-2.html)
    (Samuel Thibault, 2011-08-05: *I had a look at those, some are spurious;
    the realloc issues are for real*).

            <mcsim> has anyone used splint on hurd?
            <mcsim> this is tool for statically checking C programs
            <mcsim> seems I made it work

        <vsrinivas> two things you can do -- there is an environment variable
          (DEBUG_MALLOC_ iirc?) that can be set to 2 to make ptmalloc (glibc's
          allocator) more forceful and verbose wrt error checking
        <vsrinivas> another is to grab a copy of Tor's source tree and copy out
          OpenBSD's allocator (its a clearly-identifyable file in the tree);
          LD_PRELOAD it or link it into your app, it is even more aggressive
          about detecting memory misuse.
        <vsrinivas> third, Red hat has a gdb python plugin that can instrument
          glibc's heap structure. its kinda handy, might help?
        <vsrinivas> MALLOC_CHECK_ was the envvar you want, sorry.

  * In context of [[!message-id
    "1341350006-2499-1-git-send-email-rbraun@sceen.net"]]/the `alloca` issue
    mentioned in [[gnumach_page_cache_policy]]:

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-08:

        <youpi> braunr: there's actually already an ifdef REDZONE in libthreads

    It's `RED_ZONE`.

        <youpi> except it seems clumsy :)
        <youpi> ah, no, the libthreads code properly sets the guard, just for
          grow-up stacks

  * Input fuzzing

    Not a new topic; has been used (and a paper published) for early UNIX
    tools, I[[I|tschwinge]]RC.

      * <http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/zzuf>

    What about some [[RPC]] fuzzing?
