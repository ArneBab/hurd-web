[[!tag stable_URL open_issue_binutils]]

Here's what's to be done for maintaining GNU Binutils.

As these tools primarily deal with low-level parts of the target architecture
and the object file format (ELF ABI), which are essentially (at least meant to
be) the same, there shouldn't be many differences comparing the binutils
between the GNU/Hurd and GNU/Linux ports, for example.  There are a few,
though, as explained below.

  * Globally

      * a.out, COFF, PE image support and 64 bit support are not interesting.

      * In the testsuites, `.exp` and `.d` files very likely should not only
        care for `*-*-linux*`, but also `*-*-gnu*`.  (If the need to be
        conditionalized like this at all.)

  * `bfd/`

      * `config.bfd`

          * `i[3-7]86-*-gnu*`

            Comparing to `i[3-7]86-*-linux-*`:

              * `i386linux_vec` -- a.out.

              * `i386pei_vec` -- PE.

              * 64 bit.

      * `configure.host`

        Souldn't need anything.  x86 Linux neither.

      * `configure.in`

        Linux:

          * `COREFILE=trad-core.lo` with `TRAD_HEADER='"hosts/i386linux.h"'`

            We don't have any such core file support configured.  TODO: should
            we?  Where is this core file reading exactly used?  GDB?

          * `i386linux_vec` -- a.out.

          * `i386pei_vec` -- PE.

  * `binutils/`

      * `configure.tgt`

  * `gas/`

      * `config/te-gnu.h`

        C.f. `te-linux.h`; search tree for `TE_LINUX` vs. `TE_GNU` usage.

          * `tc-i386.h`

            Sole `TE_LINUX` usage is for a.out.

      * `configure.tgt`

  * `ld/`

     * `configure.host`

         * `*-*-gnu*`

            TODO: resolve `crt0.o` vs. `crt1.o` issue.  [[Testsuite
            failures|binutils#static]].

      * `configure.tgt`

          * `i[3-7]86-*-gnu*`

            Compare to `i[3-7]86-*-linux-*`, but don't need a.out (`i386linux`)
            and 64 bit support.


# Build

Here's a log of a binutils build run; this is from our [[Git repository's
11637a710adc7baea102d0ef5975b7a92b07aea1 (2011-10-11)
sources|source_repositories/binutils]], run on kepler.SCHWINGE and
coulomb.SCHWINGE.

    $ export LC_ALL=C
    $ ../master/configure --prefix="$PWD".install SHELL=/bin/dash CC=gcc-4.6 CXX=g++-4.6 2>&1 | tee log_build
    [...]
    $ make 2>&1 | tee log_build_
    [...]

Different hosts may default to different shells and compiler versions; thus
harmonized.

This takes up around 120 MiB, and needs roughly 4 min on kepler.SCHWINGE and
15 min on coulomb.SCHWINGE.


## Analysis

x86 GNU/Linux' and GNU/Hurd's configurations are slightly different, thus mask
out most of the differences that are due to GNU/Linux supporting more core file
formats, and more emulation vectors.

    $ diff -wu <(ssh kepler.SCHWINGE 'cd tmp/source/binutils/ && cat hurd/master.build/log_build* | sed -e "s%\(/media/data\)\?${PWD}%[...]%g"' | sed -f open_issues/binutils/log_build-linux.sed) <(ssh coulomb.SCHWINGE 'cd tmp/binutils/ && cat hurd/master.build/log_build* | sed -e "s%\(/media/erich\)\?${PWD}%[...]%g"' | sed -f open_issues/binutils/log_build-hurd.sed) > open_issues/binutils/log_build.diff

[[log_build.diff]].


# Install

    $ make install 2>&1 | tee log_install
    [...]

This takes up around 70 MiB, and needs roughly 1 min on kepler.SCHWINGE and 3
min on coulomb.SCHWINGE.


## Analysis

    $ diff -wu <(ssh kepler.SCHWINGE 'cd tmp/source/binutils/ && cat hurd/master.build/log_install | sed -e "s%\(/media/data\)\?${PWD}%[...]%g"' | sed -f open_issues/binutils/log_install-linux.sed) <(ssh coulomb.SCHWINGE 'cd tmp/binutils/ && cat hurd/master.build/log_install | sed -e "s%\(/media/erich\)\?${PWD}%[...]%g"' | sed -f open_issues/binutils/log_install-hurd.sed) > open_issues/binutils/log_install.diff

[[log_install.diff]].

  * `libtool: finish`: `ldconfig` is not run for the Hurd.


# Testsuite

    $ make -k check
    [...]

This needs roughly 3 min on kepler.SCHWINGE and 13 min on coulomb.SCHWINGE.

    $ ssh kepler.SCHWINGE 'cd tmp/source/binutils/ && cat hurd/master.build/*/*.sum hurd/master.build/*/*/*.sum | sed -e "s%\(/media/data\)\?${PWD}%[...]%g"' > open_issues/binutils/sum_linux
    $ ssh coulomb.SCHWINGE 'cd tmp/binutils/ && cat hurd/master.build/*/*.sum hurd/master.build/*/*/*.sum | sed -e "s%\(/media/erich\)\?${PWD}%[...]%g"' > open_issues/binutils/sum_hurd

Comparing the results files, [[sum_linux]] to [[sum_hurd]]:

    $ diff -u -F ^Running open_issues/binutils/sum_linux open_issues/binutils/sum_hurd > open_issues/binutils/sum.diff

[[open_issues/binutils/sum.diff]].


## Analysis

  * <a name="static"><!-- stable_URL -->`FAIL: static [...]`</a>

    The testsuite isn't prepared for using `crt0.o` instead of `crt1.o`
    depending on whether a static or dynamic executable is created.  Documented
    in `ld/configure.host`.  Perhaps we should finally rewrite this messy code
    in glibc?

  * <a name="64ksec">`FAIL: ld-elf/64ksec`</a>

    On the idle grubber, this one takes a few minutes wall time to complete
    successfully ([[I/O system
    weakness|performance/io_system/binutils_ld_64ksec]]), so assuming some
    system load variation, the testsuite's timeout may trigger.

  * <a name="weak"><!-- stable_URL -->`FAIL: ELF weak [...]`</a>

    [[I|tschwinge]] suppose this is due to us having an override w.r.t. weak
    symbol handling in glibc, needed for our external [[/libpthread]].  TODO:
    document properly.
