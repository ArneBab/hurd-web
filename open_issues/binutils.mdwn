Here's what's to be done for maintaining GNU Binutils.

# Configuration

Last checked against e83f2cdb9a77350370b96952e54bb785d1c84f4e (2010-10-30).

  * Globally

      * a.out, COFF, PE image support and 64 bit support are not interesting.

      * In the testsuites, `.exp` and `.d` files very likely should not only
        care for `*-*-linux*`, but also `*-*-gnu*`.  (If the need to be
        conditionalized like this at all.)

  * `bfd/`

      * `config.bfd`

          * `i[3-7]86-*-gnu*`

            Comparing to `i[3-7]86-*-linux-*`:

              * `i386linux_vec` -- a.out.

              * `i386pei_vec` -- PE.

              * 64 bit.

      * `configure.host`

        Souldn't need anything.  x86 Linux neither.

      * `configure.in`

        Linux:

          * `COREFILE=trad-core.lo` with `TRAD_HEADER='"hosts/i386linux.h"'`

            We don't have any such core file support configured.  TODO: should
            we?  Where is this core file reading exactly used?  GDB?

          * `i386linux_vec` -- a.out.

          * `i386pei_vec` -- PE.

  * `binutils/`

      * `configure.tgt`

  * `gas/`

      * `config/te-gnu.h`

        C.f. `te-linux.h`; search tree for `TE_LINUX` vs. `TE_GNU` usage.

          * `tc-i386.h`

            Sole `TE_LINUX` usage is for a.out.

      * `configure.tgt`

  * `ld/`

     * `configure.host`

         * `*-*-gnu*`

            TODO: resolve `crt0.o` vs. `crt1.o` issue.  [[Testsuite
            failures|binutils_testsuite#static]].

      * `configure.tgt`

          * `i[3-7]86-*-gnu*`

            Compare to `i[3-7]86-*-linux-*`, but don't need a.out (`i386linux`)
            and 64 bit support.
