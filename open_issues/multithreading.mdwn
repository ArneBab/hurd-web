Hurd servers / VFS libraries are multithreaded, roughly using one thread per
incoming request.  This is not the best approach: it doesn't really make sense
to scale the number of worker threads with the number of incoming requests, but
instead they should be scaled according to the backends' characteristics.

The [[hurd/Critique]] should have some more on this.


Alternative approaches:

  * Continuation-passing style

  * [libtcr - Threaded Coroutine Library](http://oss.linbit.com/libtcr/)

  * [[Erlang-style_parallelism]]
