    <guillem> pavkac: btw are you aware there's already some code to change the
      keymap for the mach console (I think originally from the hurdfr guys, but
      I cannot remember exactly from where I got it from :/)
    <guillem> pavkac: http://www.hadrons.org/~guillem/tmp/hurd-keymap.tgz
    <pavkac> guillem: No, I didn't know. I'll diff it and try to follow.
    <guillem> pavkac: it would be nice to maybe integrate it properly into the
      hurd
    <guillem> you'll see the code is pretty basic, so extending it would be
      nice too I guess :)
    <pavkac> guillem: OK, I'll see to it. Unfortunately I'm quite busy this
      week. Have a lot of homeworks to school. :/
    <pavkac> guillem: But, I'll find some time during weekend.
    <youpi> maybe it'd be simpler to add it to the hurd package and use that
      from the console-setup package indeed
    <youpi> but copyright issues should be solved
    <youpi> unless we simply put this into hurdextras
    <guillem> ok found this:
      http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-hurd@lists.debian.org/msg02456.html
    <guillem> and
      http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-hurd@lists.debian.org/msg01173.html
    <guillem> which seems to be the original Mark's code
    <guillem> AFAIR I contributed the the spanish keymap and some additional
      key definitions for loadkeys
    <guillem> and http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2000/10/msg00130.html
    <pavkac> I've fetched all. :) But I must leave, good night if you're in
      Europe. :)
    <guillem> pavkac: the tarball I provided should be the latest, the others
      are mostly to track the provenance of the source
