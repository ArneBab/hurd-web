    <tschwinge> scolobb: In wiki edit 60accafa79f645ae61b578403f7fc0c11914b725 I see that you intend(ed) to use syslog for logging debug messages.  I thought I'd point you to http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2007-02/msg00042.html -- no idea if that's still an issue or what went wrong at that time.  Perhaps you can have a look?
    <scolobb> tschwinge: Thanks for information! Currently I'm logging some debug messages to a simple file, but I'll now check whether the issue you've pointed out is still present.
    <scolobb> tschwinge: I am getting absolutely abnormal results: when I call syslog() from a simple C program for the first time, the message goes to the system log. However, any further calls to syslog() do just nothing... I am able to send something to syslog only after reboot (it doesn't help if I restart syslogd).
