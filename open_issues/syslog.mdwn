      I see that you intend(ed) to use syslog for logging debug messages.  I
      thought I'd point you to
      http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2007-02/msg00042.html -- no
      idea if that's still an issue or what went wrong at that time.  Perhaps
      you can have a look?
    <scolobb> tschwinge: Thanks for information! Currently I'm logging some
      debug messages to a simple file, but I'll now check whether the issue
      you've pointed out is still present.
    <scolobb> tschwinge: I am getting absolutely abnormal results: when I call
      syslog() from a simple C program for the first time, the message goes to
      the system log. However, any further calls to syslog() do just
      nothing... I am able to send something to syslog only after reboot (it
      doesn't help if I restart syslogd).

    < pinotree> wow, `logger` + a simple C udp server can cause havoc
    < pinotree> youpi: ever seen something like
      http://paste.debian.net/hidden/72cf4b77/ ?
    < pinotree> and then also other servers (like pflocal, pfinet, few more)
      start becoming crazy (using 100% cpu)
    < youpi> nope
    < pinotree> iirc in one of the few tries i got the message "Resource lost."
      from the closed ssh connection
    < pinotree> i was trying to see why syslog doesn't work, but this basically
      surprised me...
    < pinotree> oh, i found an apparently working syslog daemon
    < pinotree> dsyslog
    < gg0> have you tried syslog-ng? IIRC it writes in /var/log/messages by
      default.
    < pinotree> yeah, it seems to stop receiving messages are few
    < pinotree> gg0: are you using syslog-ng?
    < gg0> pinotree: I should fire hurd vm up. I seem I kept dirty-patched
      busybox syslog, I don't even know if it works, at least it starts
      http://bugs.debian.org/636162
    < pinotree> maintainer said "not really"
    < gg0> well, if all other syslogs use shm and sems, they won't work too,
      right?
    < youpi> shm should work with the latest libc
    < youpi> what won't is sysv sem
    < youpi> (i.e. semget)
