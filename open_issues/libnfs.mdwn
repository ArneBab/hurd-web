IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-01-09:

    <pinotree> https://github.com/sahlberg/libnfs ← maybe it could be used for
      nfs support, instead of the rpc stuff "removed" in newer glibc versions
    <antrik> pinotree: sounds like it could do much more than just the RPC
      stuff -- definitely interesting :-)
    <pinotree> hm but it seems to be an abstraction over either classic rpc or
      tirpc
    <pinotree> (anyway, it is packaged already in debian)
    <antrik> good licensing too
    <antrik> I guess I'll modify the GSoC task to "rework the Hurd NFS client
      to use libnfs" :-)
    <pinotree> the nfs translator?
    <antrik> yes
