    <braunr> we need a netstat command
    <pinotree> wouldn't that require rpcs and notifications in pfinet to get
      info on the known sockets?
    <braunr> depends on the interface
    <braunr> netstat currently uses /proc/net/* so that's out of the question
    <braunr> but a bsd netstat using ioctls could do the job
    <braunr> i'm not sure if it's done that way
    <braunr> i don't see why it would require notifications though
    <pinotree> if add such rpcs to pfinet, you could show the sockets in procfs
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> that's the clean way :p
    <braunr> but why notifications ?
    <pinotree> to get changes on data of sockets (status change, i/o activity,
      etc)
    <pinotree> (possibly i'm forgetting some already there features to know
      that)
    <braunr> the socket state is centralized in pfinet
    <braunr> netstat polls it
    <braunr> (or asks it once)
