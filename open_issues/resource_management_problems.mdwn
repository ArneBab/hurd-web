[[Mach]] interfaces do not allow for proper resource accounting, when a server
allocates resources on behalf of a client.

Mach can't do a good job at resource management, as it doesn't have enough
information how resources are used: which data is important and which is
discardable, for example.

These issues are what Neal Walfield is working on with his new kernel
[[viengoos]].
