    <barrucadu> I've been going through the xmlfs code, and plan to have it
      monitor the backing store (xml file) for changes and update the presented
      directory hierarchy when something is changed; is there a better way to
      check a file for changes beyond checking its modification time every few
      minutes?
    <tschwinge> barrucadu: In the Hurd spirit, you'd use file_notice_changes
      (fs.defs).
    <barrucadu> thanks
    <youpi> we should manage to work out an inotify interface around it, btw
    <pochu> like gamin?
    <pinotree> imho making gamin work should gain all the fam-using
      applications
    <pochu> (which, looking at the sources, seems to support hurd already, not
      sure why it's not built)
    <pinotree> pochu: the hurd_notify of gamin does not build OOTB
    <pochu> > /build/buildd/gamin-0.1.10/./libgamin/gam_data.c:476: error:
      'PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE' undeclared (first use in this function)
    <pinotree> there are few patches in bugzilla to make it compile
    <pochu> if they work, and you point me to them, I can upload a new gamin
      with them included
    <pinotree> #315644, #588337. #605246
    <pinotree> and iirc there's something else i have locally but not send yet
    <pochu> please check and submit :)
    <pinotree> ah no, those three contains all the build issues
    <pinotree> .. plus relative proposed fixes
    <pochu> ok, I'll try to get to it soonish
    <pinotree> and you should know about two of them already ;D
    <pochu> please remind me if I don't :)

Apparently fanotify is cosidered inotify's successor, so we might directly go
supporting that one instead, or both.  --[[tschwinge]], 2011-05-10
