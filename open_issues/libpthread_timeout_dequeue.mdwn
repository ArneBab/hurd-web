    <braunr> pthread_cond_timedwait and pthread_mutex_timedlock *can* produce
      segfaults in our implementation
    <braunr> if a timeout happens, but before the thread dequeues itself,
      another tries to wake it, it will be dequeued twice
    <braunr> this is the issue i spent a week on when working on fixing select
