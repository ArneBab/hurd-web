    <braunr> jkoenig: why does gnumach appear as "root=device:hd0s1" in ps ?
    <jkoenig> braunr, it's the closest we can do to its command line
    <braunr> doesn't it deserve something special like kernel threads in linux
      ?
    <braunr> so that it's actually clear that it's a special task/process
    <jkoenig> you mean something like [mach root=device:hd0s1] ?
    <braunr> something like that yes
    <braunr> also, it would be nice if gnumach threads could actually be seen,
      i don't remember if the mach interface allows it though
