[[!meta title="SSH: PTY allocation request failed"]]

Occasionally seen when `ssh`ing to a Hurd system:

    $ ssh [...]
    PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
    GNU laplace 0.9 GNU-Mach 1.8+git20180218-486-dbg/Hurd-0.9 i686-AT386
    This is the GNU Hurd.  Welcome.  [...]
    [No prompt displayed.]
    [C-d]
    Connection to [...] closed.

That is, we failed to get a PTY allocated.

We currently set up a limited number of translator nodes providing preallocated
PTYs ([[hurd/translator/term]] translator instances), instead of dynamically
allocating via `/dev/ptmx`, for example.
(Which might or might not resolve this issue; there might be some resource leak
involved?)

Last seen timestamp: 2018-07 (lost exact date).
