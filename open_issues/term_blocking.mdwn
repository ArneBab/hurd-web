There must be some blocking / dead-locking (?) problem in `term`:

    # w | grep [t]sch
    tschwing  p1 192.168.10.60: Tue 8PM  0:03  2172 /bin/bash
    tschwing  p2 192.168.10.60: Tue 4PM 40hrs   689 emacs
    tschwing  p3 192.168.10.60:  8:52PM 11:37 15307 /bin/bash
    tschwing  p0 192.168.10.60:  6:42PM 11:47  8104 /bin/bash
    tschwing  p8 192.168.10.60:  8:27AM  0:02 16510 /bin/bash

Now open a new screen window, or login shell, or...

    # ps -Af | tail
    [...]
    tschwinge 16538  676  p6  0:00.08 /bin/bash
        root 16554   128  co  0:00.09 ps -Af
        root 16555   128  co  0:00.01 tail

`bash` is started (on `p6`), but newer makes it to the shell promt; doesn't
even start to execute `.bash_profile` / `.bashrc`.  The next shell started, on
the next available pseudoterminal, will work without problems.

The `term` on `p6` has already been running before:

    # ps -Af | grep [t]typ6
        root  6871     3   -  5:45.86 /hurd/term /dev/ptyp6 pty-master /dev/ttyp6

Killed it, and things were fine again.
