There must be some blocking / dead-locking (?) problem in `term`.

[[!toc]]


# Original Findings

    # w | grep [t]sch
    tschwing  p1 192.168.10.60: Tue 8PM  0:03  2172 /bin/bash
    tschwing  p2 192.168.10.60: Tue 4PM 40hrs   689 emacs
    tschwing  p3 192.168.10.60:  8:52PM 11:37 15307 /bin/bash
    tschwing  p0 192.168.10.60:  6:42PM 11:47  8104 /bin/bash
    tschwing  p8 192.168.10.60:  8:27AM  0:02 16510 /bin/bash

Now open a new screen window, or login shell, or...

    # ps -Af | tail
    [...]
    tschwinge 16538  676  p6  0:00.08 /bin/bash
        root 16554   128  co  0:00.09 ps -Af
        root 16555   128  co  0:00.01 tail

`bash` is started (on `p6`), but newer makes it to the shell promt; doesn't
even start to execute `.bash_profile` / `.bashrc`.  The next shell started, on
the next available pseudoterminal, will work without problems.

The `term` on `p6` has already been running before:

    # ps -Af | grep [t]typ6
        root  6871     3   -  5:45.86 /hurd/term /dev/ptyp6 pty-master /dev/ttyp6

In this situation, `w` will sometimes report erroneous values for *IDLE*
for the process using that terminal.

Killed that `term` instance, and things were fine again.


All this reproducible happens while running the [[GDB testsuite|gdb]].

---

Have a freshly started shell blocking on such a `term` instance.

The very same behavior is still observable as of 2011-03-24.

Next: rebooted; on console started root shell, screen, a few spare windows; as
user started GDB test suite, noticed the PTY it's using; in a root shell
started GDB (the system one, for `.debug` stuff) on `/hurd/term`, `set
noninvasive on`, attach to the *term* that GDB is using.


# Formal Verification

This issue may be a simple programming error, or it may be more complicated.

Methods of [[formal_verification]] should be applied to confirm that there is
no error in `/hurd/term`'s logic itself.  There are tools for formal
verification/[[code_analysis]] that can likely help here.

There is a [[!FF_project 277]][[!tag bounty]] on this task.
