IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-10-12:

    <pinotree> hm, why our sys/param.h #define's BSD?
    <braunr> pinotree: because we're evil
    <pinotree> is that correct?
    <pinotree> (the define, not the evilness)
    <braunr> pinotree: i think it's because the Hurd is closer to the BSD
      interfaces, probably because of Mach (which is itself derived from
      BSD4.2)
    <pinotree> braunr: but mach being bsd-ish won't make the userland (glibc)
      interfaces bsd-ish, will it?
    <braunr> pinotree: no
    <pinotree> braunr: so...? :)
    <braunr> pinotree: i guesse there are bsdisms in the glibc hurd specific
      code, possibly because of mach
    <braunr> or they used to be bsdisms, before being standardized
    <braunr> e.g. mmap
    <pinotree> braunr: hrmm...
    <antrik> braunr: the BSDisms are there on purpose... Hurd was originally
      even meant to be binary-compatible with BSD
    <antrik> nothing to do with Mach really
    <braunr> antrik: ok
