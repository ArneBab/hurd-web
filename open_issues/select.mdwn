There are a lot of reports about this issue, but no thorough analysis.


# `elinks`

IRC, unknown channel, unknown date.

    <paakku> This is related to ELinks... I've looked at the select()
      implementation for the Hurd in glibc and it seems that giving it a short
      timeout could cause it not to report that file descriptors are ready.
    <paakku> It sends a request to the Mach port of each file descriptor and
      then waits for responses from the servers.
    <paakku> Even if the file descriptors have data for reading or are ready
      for writing, the server processes might not respond immediately.
    <paakku> So if I want ELinks to check which file descriptors are ready, how
      long should the timeout be in order to ensure that all servers can
      respond in time?
    <paakku> Or do I just imagine this problem?
