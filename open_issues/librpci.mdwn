[[!tag open_issue_gnumach open_issue_hurd]]

2004 to 2007, Anand Babu has been working some on this project.  It is still in
rather early stages.  It's meant to become an extension/complement to
[[hurd/debugging/rpctrace]].

  * <https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/rpci>

    > A C language library for interposing ports of a Hurd task running on top
    > of GNU Mach micro-kernel. Using this library, it would be possible to
    > implement a trace/replay system, RPC debugger, sandbox, etc.

    On top of that, a debugger was planned:

    > A RPC level debugger with useful command set to analyze/manipulate a task
    > at run time. For example, the user will be able to set RPC break points,
    > manipulate port rights and data, trace and replay a task.

If there is interest, the existing source code could be moved from the CVS
repository into the [[source_repositories/incubator]] ([[tschwinge]] already
locally converted it to Git.)
