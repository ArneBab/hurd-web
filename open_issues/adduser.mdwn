[[!tag open_issue_porting]]

`adduser` does work as expected, the following warnings are spurious, they just
appear when one doesn't have the nscd package. They do not appear on Linux boxes
because there posix_spawn doesn't report ENOENT for exec(). POSIX indeed says
that `if the error occurs after the calling process successfully returns, the
child process shall exit with exit status 127'. The Hurd however reports all
errors, thus the warning.

    $ sudo adduser foo
