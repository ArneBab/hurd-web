IRC, #hurd, 2010-08-12

    <jkoenig> Looking at hurd.git, shouldn't {hurd,include}/Makefile's "all" target do something, and shouldn't pretty much everything depend on them? As it stands it seems that the system headers are used and the potentially newer ones never get built, except maybe on "install" (which is seemingly never called from the top-level Makefile)
    <jkoenig> I would fix it, but something tells me that maybe it's a feature :-)
    <antrik> jkoenig: the headers are provided by glibc, along with the stubs
    <jkoenig> antrik, you mean, even those built from the .defs files in hurd/ ?
    <antrik> yes
    <jkoenig> oh, ok then.
    <antrik> as glibc provides the stubs (in libhurduser), the headers also have to come from there, or they would get out of sync
    <jkoenig> hmm, shouldn't glibc also provide /usr/share/msgids/hurd.msgids, then?
    <antrik> jkoenig: not necessarily. the msgids describe what the servers actually understand. if the stubs are missing from libhurduser, that's no reason to leave out the msgids...
    <jkoenig> ok this makes sense
