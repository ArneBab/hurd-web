On 2010-11-28, Austin English contacted us, stating that he's working on
porting [Wine](http://winehq.org/) to the GNU/Hurd.

It is not yet clear how difficult this is going to be, what sort of
requirements Wine has: only libc / POSIX / etc., or if there are
*advanced* things like [[system_call]] trapping involved, too.

[[Samuel|samuelthibault]] suspects that *there's some need for LDT table
allocation. There is kernel support for this,* however.


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-08-11

    < arethusa> I've been trying to make Wine work inside a Debian GNU/Hurd VM,
      and to that end, I've successfully compiled the latest sources from Git
      after installing the libc (devel) packages from experimental and
      personally patching Wine with http://pastebin.com/rg6dx09G

[[rg6dx09G.patch]]

    < arethusa> my question is, when trying to launch Wine, I'm seeing "wine
      client error:0: sendmsg: (os/kern) invalid address" from the client side,
      whereas the wineserver seems to be starting and running correctly, how
      could I debug this issue further? using rpctrace doesn't seem to help, as
      the trace just hangs when run on the Wine loader instead of yielding
      insight
    < kilobug> arethusa: isn't there a wine debuguer that can start a gdb when
      wine encounters an error or something like that ?
    < arethusa> it's too early for that
    < kilobug> or least give you a full traceback of the wine code where the
      error occur ?
    < arethusa> the error is happening during initial connect to the
      wineserver, in dlls/ntdll/server.c
    < arethusa> but that doesn't help me figure out why sendmsg would error out
      in this way
    < arethusa>
      http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/blob/HEAD:/dlls/ntdll/server.c#l361
    < azeem_> arethusa: probably some of the msghdr entries are not supported
      by the Hurd's glib
    < azeem_> c
    < pinotree> haha, socket credentials, which we don't support yet
    < azeem_> yep
    < pinotree> youpi: ↑ another case ;)
    < azeem_> arethusa: just implement those and it should work
    < kilobug> in pflocal ? or glibc ?
    < pinotree> pflocal
    < arethusa> azeem_: hmm, okay, thanks
    < pinotree> arethusa: their lack is a known issue, and makes things like
      dbus and gamin not work
    < arethusa> it's
      https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/open_issues/sendmsg_scm_creds.html and
      related links I assume?

[[sendmsg_scm_creds]]

    < youpi> yes
    < pinotree> (but that patch is lame)


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-02

    <gnu_srs> youpi: I've come a little further with wine, see debian bug
      #724681 (same problem).
    <gnu_srs> Now the problem  is probably due to the specific address space
      and stack issues to be
    <gnu_srs> fixed for wine to run as braunr pointed out some months ago
      (IRC?) when we discussed wine.
