On 2010-11-28, Austin English contacted us, stating that he's working on
porting [Wine](http://winehq.org/) to the GNU/Hurd.

It is not yet clear how difficult this is going to be, what sort of
requirements Wine has: only libc / POSIX / etc., or if there are
*advanced* things like [[system_call]] trapping involved, too.

[[Samuel|samuelthibault]] suspects that *there's some need for LDT table
allocation. There is kernel support for this,* however.
