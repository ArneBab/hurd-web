    <braunr> hm, gdb isn't able to determine which thread is running when
      attaching to a process

    <braunr> woah, now that's a weird message !
    <braunr> when using gdb on a hanged ext2fs :
    <braunr> Pid 938 has an additional task suspend count of 1; clear it? (y or
      n) 
    <braunr> when hanged, gdb thinks the target task is already being debugged
      :/
    <braunr> no wonder why it's completely stuck
    <braunr> hm, the task_suspend might actually be the crash-dump-core server
      attempting to create the core :/
    <braunr> hm interesting, looks like a problem with the
      diskfs_catch_exception macro
    <pinotree> braunr: what's up with it?
    <braunr> pinotree: it uses setjmp
    <braunr> hm random corruptions :/
    <braunr> definitely looks like a concurrency problem
