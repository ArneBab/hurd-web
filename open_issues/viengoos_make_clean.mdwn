    <neal> tschwinge: If I do a make clean n the root directory, follow that with a configure, configure fails with: configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
    <neal> this is in config.log: /home/neal/src/hurd-l4/build/lib/gcc/i686-pc-viengoos-gnu/4.2.2/../../../../i686-pc-viengoos-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lc
    <neal> rt 
    <tschwinge> neal: Should make clean also remove srcdir/gcc/gcc and binutils, as you do it with newlib?
    <neal> I'd prefer it not to
    <neal> as I use make clean to prep the tree for new configure changes
    <neal> and build gcc takes a long time
    <neal> (as does newlib, but newlib in this case needs to be rebuilt)
