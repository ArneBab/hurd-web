Comparing to GNU/Linux, on GNU/Hurd it happens much more often and easily for
*screen* sessions to become *dead*.  This is annoying, as it defeats one of
*screen*'s main purposes.

[[!toc]]


# One reproducible scenario goes like this

  * `ssh [somewhere]`,

  * start a *screen* session, and some long-running process *P* in there,

  * at some point the link is forcefully terminated (also known as disconnect
    after 24 hours with consumer DSL),

  * *P* will continue to execute,

  * at some point, *P* will terminate / hang (after having received some kind
    of signal?), and the *screen* session will be reported as *dead*.


# Another one, not as often reproduced

  * `ssh [somewhere]`,

  * start a *screen* session, and some long-running process *P* in there,

  * at some point the link is forcefully terminated (also known as disconnect
    after 24 hours with consumer DSL),

  * `ssh [somewhere]`,

  * `screen -x`, and notice that *P* will *immediatelly* terminate / hang
    (after having received some kind of signal?), and the *screen* session will
    *immediatelly* be reported as *dead*.  (Perhaps the other way round: upon
    re-attaching, the *screen* session goes bonkers and takes *P* with it?)

    <antrik> tschwinge: hm... haven't seen screen dying in a long time
    <tschwinge> antrik: It's easy, and goes like this: have a session on one
      system, log in from another, do screen -x and wait some time.
    <antrik> I do this regularily. haven't had a crash in ages.
    <antrik> (BTW, I'm not sure I ever had a crash on srceen -x... at that
      time, I wasn't using -x. I often had crashes with screen -r. my
      impression back then was that it works better when doing -rd -- in fact,
      I always do that now, so I can't say whether crashes still happen with
      only -r...)

2011-10-26:

    <antrik> so I was saying the other day that I haven't had a screen crash in
      a long time... well, here it was :-(
    <antrik> this time it didn't crash on reconnect though, but already
      before. probably when I killed the hanging ssh connection
