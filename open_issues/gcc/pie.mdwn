    <pinotree> tschwinge: i'm not totally sure, but it seems the pie options
      for gcc/ld are causing issues
    <pinotree> namely, producing executables that sigsegv straight away
    <tschwinge> pinotree: OK, I do remember some issues about these, too.
    <tschwinge> Also for -pg.
    <tschwinge> These have in common that they use different crt*.o files for
      linking.
    <tschwinge> Might well be there's some bugs there.
    <pinotree> one way is to try the w3m debian build: the current build
      configuration enables also pie, which in turns makes an helper executable
      (mktable) sigsegv when invoked
    <pinotree> if «,-pie» is appended to the DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS variable
      in debian/rules, pie is not added and the resulting mktable runs
      correctly


## IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2012-11-09

    <pinotree> youpi: ah, as i noted to tschwinge earlier, it seems -fPIE -pie
      miscompile stuff
    <youpi> uh
    <pinotree> this causes the w3m build failure and (indirectly, due to elinks
      built with -pie) aptitude
