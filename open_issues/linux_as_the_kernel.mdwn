Instead of attempting a [[history/port_to_another_microkernel]], or writing an
own one, an implementation of a Hurd system could use another existing
operating system/kernel, like [[UNIX]], for example, the Linux kernel.  This is
not a [[microkernel]], but that is not an inherent hindrance; depending on what
the goals are.

There has been an attempt for building a [[Mach_on_top_of_POSIX]].

Richard's X-15 Mach re-implementation:

    <braunr> and in case you didn't notice, it's stalled
    <braunr> actually i don't intend to work on it for the time being
    <braunr> i'd rather do as neal suggested: take linux, strip it, and give it
      a mach interface
    <braunr> (if your goal really is to get something usable for real world
      tasks)
    <antrik> braunr: why would you want to strip down Linux? I think one of the
      major benefits of building a Linux-Frankenmach would be the ability to
      use standard Linux functionality alongside Hurd...
    <braunr> we could have a linux x86_64 based mach replacement in "little"
      time, with a compatible i386 interface for the hurd
    <braunr> antrik: well, many of the vfs and network subsystems would be hard
      to use
    <antrik> BTW, one of the talks at FOSDEM was about the possibility of using
      different kernels for Genode, and pariticularily focused on the
      possibilities with using Linux... unfortunately, I wasn't able to follow
      the whole talk; but they mentioned similar possibilities to what I'm
      envisioning here :-)
