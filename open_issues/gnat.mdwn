[[!meta title="Enable Ada programming (GCC: GNAT)"]]

[[!tag open_issue_gcc]]

Make the Ada programming language available on GNU/Hurd in its [[GCC]] GNAT
implementation, and enable Hurd-specific features.

There is a [[!FF_project 259]][[!tag bounty]] on this task.

# Part I

First, make the language functional, have its test suite pass without errors.

## Debian GCC

There has a patch been added for GNU/kFreeBSD:
`bfe081336914729fc0180c07ab4afa41965100f2`, `git-svn-id:

    <gnu_srs> I've found the remaining problem with gnat backtrace for Hurd!
      Related to the stack frame.
    <gnu_srs> This version does not work: one relying on static assumptions
      about the frame layout
    <gnu_srs> Causing segfaults.
    <gnu_srs> Any interest to create a test case out of that piece of code,
      taken from gcc/ada/tracebak.c?
    <braunr> gnu_srs: sure


### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-18

    <braunr> "Digging further revealed that the GNU/Hurd stack frame does not
      seem to
    <braunr> be static enough to define USE_GENERIC_UNWINDER in
      gcc/ada/tracebak.c.
    <braunr> "
    <braunr> what do you mean by a "stack frame does not seem to be static
      enough" ?
    <gnu_srs> I can qoute from the source file if you want. Otherwise look at
      the code yourself: gcc/ada/tracebak,c
    <gnu_srs> I mean that something is wrong with the stack frame for
      Hurd. This is the code I wanted to use as a test case for the stack.
    <gnu_srs> Remember?
    <braunr> more or less
    <braunr> ah, "static assumptions"
    <braunr> all right, i don't think anything is "wrong" with stack frames
    <braunr> but if you use a recent version of gcc, as indicated in the code,
      -fomit-frame-pointer is enabled by default
    <braunr> so your stack frame won't look like it used to be without the
      option
    <braunr> hence the need for USE_GCC_UNWINDER
    <braunr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack explains this very well
    <gnu_srs> However, kfreebsd does not seem to need USE_GCC_UNWINDER, how
      come?
    <braunr> i guess they don't omit the frame pointer
    <braunr> your fix is good btw
    <gnu_srs> thanks


### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-19

    <gnu_srs> tschwinge: The bug in #681998 should go upstream. Applied in
      Debian already. Hopefully this is the last patch needed for the port of
      GNAT to Hurd.


## Svante's patch

A basic port has been done by Svante, but there's still lots of work remaining.
The port is not yet upstream: the maintainer raised some concerns that
[[I|tschwinge]] have not yet found the time to follow up on.  While the test
results of the GCC/GNAT testsuite don't look bad (but there are a few
unresolved issues, and the testsuite appears to be a rather small one), I don't
know if the port has yet seen any real-world usage, such as using it for any
bigger Ada code bases, or any Ada testsuites.

# Part II

Next, Hurd-specific features can be added.  Add an interface to the
language/environment for being able to do [[RPC]] calls, in order to program
[[hurd/translator]]s natively in Ada.
