A collection of thoughts with respect to unit testing.

We definitely want to add unit test suites to our code base.

We should select a tool that we like to use, and that is supported (not
abandoned).

  * [DejaGnu](http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/) /
    [Expect](http://expect.nist.gov/)

      * used by the [[GCC_testsuite]], [[GDB_testsuite]],
        [[binutils_testsuite]], etc.

  * The [[glibc_testsuite]] has a home-grown system (Makefile-based), likewise
    does the [[Open_POSIX_Test_Suite]].

  * [check](http://check.sourceforge.net/)

      * used by some GNU packages, for example GNU PDF (Jose E. Marchesi)

  * CodeSourcery's [QMTest](http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest)
