A collection of thoughts with respect to unit testing.

We definitely want to add unit test suites to our code base.

We should select a tool that we like to use, and that is supported (not
abandoned).

  * [SC
    Test](http://web.archive.org/web/20021204193607/sc-archive.codesourcery.com/sc_test)

  * [DejaGnu](http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/) /
    [Expect](http://expect.nist.gov/)

      * used by the [[GCC testsuite|gcc]], [[GDB_testsuite]],
        [[binutils testsuite|binutils]], etc.

  * The [[glibc_testsuite]] has a home-grown system (Makefile-based), likewise
    does the [[Open_POSIX_Test_Suite]].

  * [check](http://check.sourceforge.net/)

      * used by some GNU packages, for example GNU PDF (Jose E. Marchesi)

  * CodeSourcery's [QMTest](http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest)

      * useb by?

  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/) has an elaborate unit testsuite, which is also
    used in [Notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org/).
