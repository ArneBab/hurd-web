[[!meta title="GDB's non-stop mode"]]

[[!tag open_issue_gdb]]

GNU GDB's `gnu-nat.c` doesn't support *non-stop* mode.

Also, from <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2008-10/msg00045.html>,
GNU GDB's Pedro Alves:

> I also notice that when going through the shell in non-stop mode, it would be
