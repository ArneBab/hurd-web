    <paakku> In elinks/src/network/state.h, there is an assumption that values of errno are between 0 and 100000.  Now looking at glibc-2.5/sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/errno.h, I see that you're using values outside this range.  Have there been problems because of this?
    <youpi> eeerf
    <youpi> I had never seen a program assuming that
    <youpi> that sucks
    <paakku> It can be fixed, but that'd require some work, so I'd like to first have a clear idea of the effects.
    <youpi> fixed where ?
    <paakku> in elinks
    <youpi> k
    <paakku> by allocating just one number from our enum connection_state for system errors, and then stashing the errno value in a separate variable.
    <paakku> Anyway, if you see this cause any user-visible bugs in ELinks, please report.
