This one may be considered as a testcase for I/O system optimization.

It is taken from the [[binutils_testsuite]], `ld/ld-elf/sec64k.exp`, where this
test may occasionally trigger a timeout.  It is extracted from
cdf7c161ebd4a934c9e705d33f5247fd52975612 sources, 2010-10-24.

On the idle grubber, this one repeatedly takes a few minutes wall time to
complete successfully, contrary to a few seconds on a GNU/Linux system.

While processing the object files, there is heavy interaction with the relevant
[[hurd/translator/ext2fs]] process .  Running [[hurd/debugging/rpctrace]] on
the testee shows that (primarily) an ever-repeating series of `io_seek` and
`io_read` is being processed.  Running the testee on GNU/Linux with strace
shows the equivalent thing (`_llseek`, `read`) -- but Linux' I/O system isn't
as slow as the Hurd's.
