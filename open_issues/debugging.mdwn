# Existing

We have debugging infrastructure.  For example:

  * [[GDB]]

  * [[GNU Mach debugging|microkernel/mach/gnumach/debugging]]

  * [[GNU Hurd debugging|hurd/debugging]], including
    [[hurd/debugging/rpctrace]] and more.


# To Do

  * [[ltrace]]

  * [[latrace]]

  * [[profiling]]

  * *[Checkpoint/restart](http://lwn.net/Articles/412749/) allows the state of
    a set of processes to be saved to persistent storage, then restarted at
    some future time* -- quoting from Jonathan Corbet's 2010 Linux Kernel
    Summit report.

    This is surely a very useful facility to have for reproducing failures, for
    example.  But on the other hand it's questionable how it can help with
    debugging failures in [[GNU Hurd server|hurd/translator]]s' interactions,
    as their state is typically spread between several processes.
