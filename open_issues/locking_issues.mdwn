# Original [[community/GSoC]] Task Description

[[!inline pages=community/gsoc/project_ideas/libdiskfs_locking feeds=no]]


# ext2fs Deadlock

[[ext2fs_deadlock]].


# Formal Verification

Methods of [[formal_verification]] should be applied to get an understanding of
the behavior of the locking logic.  There are tools for formal
verification/[[code_analysis]] that can likely help here.

There is a [[!FF_project 278]][[!tag bounty]] on this task.
