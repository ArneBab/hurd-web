We don't have a `lsof` tool.  Perhaps we could cook something with having a
look at which ports are open at the moment (as [[`portinfo`|hurd/portinfo]]
does, for example)?


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-16

    <teythoon> braunr: there's something I've been working on, it's not yet
      finished but usable
    <teythoon> http://paste.debian.net/58266/
    <teythoon> it graphs port usage
    <teythoon> it's a bit heavy on the dependency-side though...
    <braunr> but
    <braunr> is it able to link rights from different ipc spaces ?
    <teythoon> no
    <teythoon> what do you mean exactly?
    <braunr> know that send right 123 in task 1 refers to receive right 321 in
      task 2
    <braunr> basically, lsof
    <braunr> i'm not sure it's possible right now, and that's what we'd really
      need
    <teythoon> does the kernel hand out this information?
    <braunr> ^
    <teythoon> right, I'm not sure it's possible either
    <braunr> but a graph maker in less than 300 is cute :)
    <braunr> 300 lines*
    <teythoon> well, it leverages pymatplotlib or something, it needs half of
      the pythonverse ;)
    <braunr> lsof and pmap and two tools we really lack on the hurd
    <teythoon> what does portinfo --translate=PID do?
    <braunr> i guess it asks proc so that ports that refer to task actually
      give useful info
    <braunr> hml
    <braunr> no
    <braunr> doesn't make sense to give a pid in this case
    <braunr> teythoon: looks like it does what we talked about
    <teythoon> :)
    <braunr> teythoon: the output looks a bit weird anyway, i think we need to
      look at the code to be sure
    <teythoon> braunr: this is what aptitude update looks like:
