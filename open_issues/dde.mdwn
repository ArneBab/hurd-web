    [DDE crash, or similar]
    <youpi> it's fake_local_irq_disable_flags(), then raw_local_irq_disable(),
      then raw_local_irq_restore(), which *does not* release the cli_lock
    <youpi> the "prove it" comment is (as I expected) completely wrong
    <youpi> npnth: http://paste.debian.net/137784/

    <youpi> could you try this patch ?
    <youpi> (I've not even tried to build it)
    <npnth> youpi: speaking of which, it still seems to hang :/  I'll 1) double
      check it applied correctly and 2) get a gdb output if it did
    <youpi> npnth: could you add printing the value of unlock_refcnt?
    <youpi> so we can check what's happening
    <npnth> unlock_refcnt is at 0, interesting
