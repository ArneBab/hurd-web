    <virtuoso015> i seem to be getting this message from the shell "-bash: /dev/fd/62: Interrupted system call"
    <virtuoso015> is it significant ?
    <youpi> I've seen this issue already yes
    <youpi> it's not
    <youpi> it's bash not handling EINTR properly
    <antrik> youpi: so this is actually a bug in bash, not Hurd generating a bogus error?
    <youpi> well, it's Hurd generating an error which bash doesn't expect to see
