Currently, GNU Mach requires the presence of the BIOS32 Service Directory for PCI access. 
The other possible methods are direct access, which is somewhat dangerous and using mmconfig, the preferred default in Linux.
Direct access is already supported, but only used if BIOS32 is present for safety reasons.
The relevant Linux code could be adapted and reused.
