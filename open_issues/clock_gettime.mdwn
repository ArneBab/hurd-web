Missing clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) (e.g. for iceweasel)

It could be a mere matter of extending the mappable clock: add it to mapped_time_value_t in gnumach, handle it in gnumach/kern/mach_clock.c, and make clock_gettime use it.

BTW, also make gettimeofday() use it, since it's way more efficient and some applications assume that it is.
