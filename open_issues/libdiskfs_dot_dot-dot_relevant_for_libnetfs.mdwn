    <tschwinge> By the way: your libdiskfs ., .. fix -- is that relevant for libnetfs as well?  (Didn't look it up so far.)
    <youpi> it could be a good idea to protect netfs users directly from there yes
    <tschwinge> But probably the backend (e.g., NFS server) would protect us in the netfs case, right?
    <youpi> possibly, but we could have locking issues in between like in libdiskfs
    <youpi> and POSIX says it's invalid anyway
    <youpi> so we'd probably better just forbid it
