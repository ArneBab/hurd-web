The /hurd/symlink translator does not work as expected:

    % settrans -ca broken /hurd/symlink missing
    % file broken
    broken: empty

Here is the expected behavior, as implemented by the short-cut logic
in lib*fs:

    % ln -s missing broken_symlink
    % file broken_symlink
    broken_symlink: broken symbolic link to missing
