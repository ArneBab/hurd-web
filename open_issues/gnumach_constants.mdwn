At compile-time, GNU Mach is parameterized with several constants.  These might
need some tuning.  Debian has some patches.

    <braunr> youpi: in ipc/ipc_hash.c, there is code which computes the size of
      the global (space, port)->entry hash table
    <braunr> youpi: you may be interested in tuning this one too
    <youpi> I know
    <braunr> ok
    <youpi> the current value is not so bad
    <youpi> it's big enough for buildds to run fine
    <braunr> 256 if i'm right
    <braunr> well
    <braunr> it won't fail
    <youpi> we're limited by the 4000 object limitation anyway
    <braunr> since it's a chained hash table
    <braunr> but increasing it may help performances a bit
    <braunr> and it certainly can't hurt much
