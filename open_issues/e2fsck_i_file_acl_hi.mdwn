    <Duck> something's broken in ext2, fsck, or the like
    <Duck>  /dev/hd0s1: i_file_acl_hi for inode 81872 (/proc) is 32, shoud be 0.
    <Duck> youpi: the other problem is probably related to http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526524
    <Duck> i'll just check when it is fixed
    <antrik> youpi: I've seen a lot of these fsck errors since the upgrade to 1.41.x
    <antrik> youpi: seems to happen whenever a passive translator is still active while the machine reboots
    <Duck> antrik: ho, so in my example this could be related to procfs then
    <antrik> Duck: don't know... I got it with various terminal-related nodes
    <antrik> other translators get terminated before ext2 it seems, so the problem doesn't happen there
    <antrik> unless the machine crashes of course
    <antrik> ah, right, it told you that it's the /proc node :-)
    <antrik> was it the only node it complained about?
    <antrik> Duck: ^
    <Duck> antrik: yes, the only one
    <youpi> so it's most probably i
    <youpi> t
    <Duck> but currently i don't have much translators around besides the base install
    <antrik> that's strange... my theory about translators active at reboot seems wrong then
    <youpi> well, maybe procps is not behaving properly
    <youpi> procfs*
    <antrik> youpi: I doubt it. I regularily get the same issue with various term nodes; and when the machine crashes rather than rebooting cleanly, many other nodes as well
    <youpi> k
    <antrik> but it's always passive translator nodes

This is due to an erroneous read/write from e2fsck, see http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3379227&group_id=2406&atid=102406
