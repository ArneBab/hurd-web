    <youpi> I still believe we have an ext2fs page cache swapping leak, however
    <youpi> as the 1.8GiB swap was full, yet the ld process was only 1.5GiB big
    <pinotree> a leak at swapping time, you mean?
    <youpi> I mean the ext2fs page cache being swapped out instead of simply
      dropped
    <pinotree> ah
    <pinotree> so the swap tends to accumulate unuseful stuff, i see
    <youpi> yes
    <youpi> the disk content, basicallyt :)

    <antrik> damn, a cp -a simply gobbles down swap space...
    <braunr> really ?
    <braunr> that's weird
    <braunr> why would a copy use so much anonymous memory ?
    <braunr> unless the external pager is so busy that the kernel falls back to
      its default pager
    <youpi> that's what I suggested some time ago
    <braunr> maybe this case should be traced in the kernel
    <braunr> a simple message in the kernel buffer to warn that this condition
      happened may help
    <youpi> I'm seeing swap space being kept used on buildds for no real reason
      except possibly backing ext2fs pages
    <youpi> that could help, yes
    <antrik> youpi: I think it was actually slpz who suggested that...
    <youpi> I think we're generally missing feedback from memory behavior
    <antrik> youpi: do you think andrei's kernel instrumentation work might be
      helpful with analyzing such things?
    <youpi> antrik: I think I suggested it too, but never mind
    <youpi> antrik: no, because it's not a trace of events that you want
    <youpi> some specific events would be useful
    <youpi> but then we don't really need a whole framework for that
    <antrik> apt-get upgrade eats swap too
    <youpi> the upgrade itself, or the computation of the ugprade?
    <youpi> apt is a memory eater nowadays
    <antrik> installing the packages
    <antrik> seems to have stabilized though after a while...
    <antrik> so perhaps it's not a leak in this case
    <youpi> ideally we should have a way to know what was put in the swap
    <braunr> how would you represent what's in the swap ?
    <antrik> the apt-get process has 46M of virtual memory above the 128 M
      baseline
    <braunr> mostly libraries i guess
    <braunr> are trheads stacks 8 MiB like on Linux ?
    <youpi> braunr: at least knowing how much of each process is in the swap
    <youpi> braunr: 2MiB
    <braunr> ok
    <youpi> vminfo could also report which parts of the address space are in
      the swap
    <antrik> youpi: would be nice to have some simple utility reporting how
      much of a process' address space is anonymous
    <antrik> (in fact, I wonder why it's not reported by standard tools such as
      ps or top... this shouldn't be too difficult I would think?)
    <antrik> it would be much more useful information than the total virt size,
      which includes rather meaningless disk and device mappings...
    <youpi> agreed
    <braunr> well
    <braunr> there are tools like pmap for this
    <braunr> unfortunately, it's difficult in mach to know what backs a
      non-anonymous mapping
    <braunr> pagers should be able to name their mappings
    <youpi> that'd be helpful for debugging yes
    <braunr> there is almost no overhead in doing that, and it would be very
      useful
    <youpi> and could lead to /proc/pid/maps
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> isn't there a maps already ?
    <youpi> nope
    <braunr> ok
    <youpi> (probably not very useful without the names)
    <braunr>  ithought i remembered maps without names, and guessed it might
      have been on the hurd for that reason
    <braunr> but i'm not sure
    <youpi> there's the vminfo command, yes
    <braunr> 14:06 < youpi> braunr: at least knowing how much of each process
      is in the swap
    <braunr> wouldn't it be clearer to do it the other way around ?
    <braunr> like a swapinfo tool indicating what it contains ?
    <youpi> sure, but it's a lot more difficult
    <braunr> really ?
    <braunr> why ?
    <youpi> because you have to traverse all the mappings
    <youpi> etc
    <youpi> (in all processes, I mean)
    <youpi> and you have to name what is waht
    <braunr> there are other ways
    <braunr> the swap is a central structure
    <youpi> while simply introducing the swap %  in vminfo
    <youpi> for a given process you know what is what
    <braunr> right
    <youpi> and doing that introduction is  probably very simple
    <braunr> that's a good point
    <braunr> top-down is effectively easier than bottom-up resolution in Mach
      VM
    <antrik> hm... the memory use caused by cp doesn't seem to be reflected in
      the virtual size of any particular process
    <antrik> ghost memory
    <braunr> what's cp vmsize at the time of the problem ?
    <antrik> it's at 134 M right now... so considering the 128 M baseline,
      nothing worth speaking of
    <braunr> right
    <braunr> maybe a copy map during I/O
    <braunr> but I don't know Mach copy maps in detail, as they have been
      eliminated from UVM
    <antrik> BTW, the memory eatup happens even before swap comes into
      play... swapping seems to be a result of the problem, not the cause
    <braunr> what do you mean ?
    <braunr> I thought swapping was the issue
    <braunr> you mean RAM is full before swapping ?
    <antrik> well, I don't know what the actual problem is... I just don't
      understand why the memory use increases without any particular process
      seeing an increase in size
    <antrik> the "free" size in vmstat decreses
    <antrik> once it's eatun up, swap space use increases
    <braunr> well it doesn't change much of it
    <braunr> the anonymous memory pager will use RAM before resorting to the
      external default-pager
    <antrik> I would suspect normal block caching... but then, shouldn't this
      show up in the memory info of the ext2 process?
    <braunr> although, again, I'm not sure of the behaviour of the anonymous
      memory pager
    <braunr> antrik: I don't know how block caching behaves
    <antrik> BTW, is it a know problem that doing ^C on a "cp -a" seems to hang
      the whole system?...
    <antrik> (the whole hurd instance that is... the other instance is not
      affected)
    <youpi> not that I know of
    <braunr> seems like a deadlock in the anonymous memory handling
    <youpi> (and I've never seen that)
    <antrik> happens both in my main system (using ancient hurd/libc) and in my
      subhurd (recently upgraded to current stuff)
    <antrik> this make testing this stuff quite a lot harder... [sigh]
    <antrik> any suggestions how to debug this hang?
    <braunr> antrik: no :/
