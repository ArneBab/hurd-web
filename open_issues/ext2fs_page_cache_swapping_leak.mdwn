    <youpi> I still believe we have an ext2fs page cache swapping leak, however
    <youpi> as the 1.8GiB swap was full, yet the ld process was only 1.5GiB big
    <pinotree> a leak at swapping time, you mean?
    <youpi> I mean the ext2fs page cache being swapped out instead of simply
      dropped
    <pinotree> ah
    <pinotree> so the swap tends to accumulate unuseful stuff, i see
    <youpi> yes
    <youpi> the disk content, basicallyt :)
