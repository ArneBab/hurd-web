    <mcsim> Hi, is that normal that memory cache "ipc_port" is 24 Mb already?
      Some memory has been already swapped out.
    <mcsim> Other caches are big too
    <braunr> how many ports ?
    <mcsim> 45922
    <braunr> yes it's normal
    <braunr> ipc_port              0010      76   4k    50  45937 302050
      24164k       4240k
    <braunr> it's a bug in exim
    <braunr> or triggered by exim, from time to time
    <braunr> lots of ports are created until the faulty processes are killed
    <braunr> the other big caches you have are vm_object and vm_map_entry,
      probably because of a big build like glibc
    <braunr> and if they remain big, it's because there was no memory pressure
      since they got big
    <braunr> memory pressure can only be caused by very large files on the
      hurd, because of the limited page cache size (4000 objects at most)
    <braunr> the reason you have swapped memory is probably because of a glibc
      test that allocates a very large (more than 1.5 GiB iirc) block and fills
      it
    <mcsim> yes
    <braunr> (a test that fails with the 2G/2G split of the debian kernel, but
      not on your vanilla version btw)
