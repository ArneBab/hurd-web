    <pinotree> eeek, usleep has the issues which i fixed in nanosleep
    <bdefreese> pinotree: ?
    * pinotree ponders a `mv sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/usleep.c
        sysdeps/mach/usleep.c`
    <pinotree> s/mv/cp/
    <bdefreese> What the heck is the point of usleep(0) anyway?  Isn't that
      basically saying suspend for 0 milliseconds?
    <youpi> it's rounded up by the kernel I guess
    <youpi> i.e. suspend for the shortest time possible (a clock tick)
    <pinotree> posix 2001 says that «If the value of useconds is 0, then the
      call has no effect.»
