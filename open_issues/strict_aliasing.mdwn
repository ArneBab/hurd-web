# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-04

    <braunr> we should perhaps build the hurd with -fno-strict-aliasing,
      considering the number of warnings i can see during the build :/
    <pinotree> braunr: wouldn't be better to "just" fix the mig-generated stubs
      instead?
    <braunr> pinotree: if we can rely on gcc for the warnings, yes
    <braunr> but i suspect there might be other silent issues in very old code
