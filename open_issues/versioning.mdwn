Things to consider regarding *versioning*.

The provider and user of any interface need to agree about how to interpret the
data being exchanged.  Internal-only interfaces can be changed easily, because
you can change the provider and user at the same time.  Interfaces that are
exposed externally require more attention, for obvious reasons.  To *change*
interfaces means to either remove, or add, or modify an existing interface.
Modify basically means to remove and then re-add a variant, re-using the former
name/identifier.

## Hurd

Transition to "normal" ELF symbol versioning/libtool?

For all libraries, the SONAME is currently set to *0.3*.  [[!message-id
desc="Not changed" "87ob7cxbu6.fsf@kepler.schwinge.homeip.net"]] when doing the
[[Hurd 0.5 release|news/2013-09-27]].


## glibc

Bump the glibc SONAME to some point, or can do everything with symbol
versioning?

In context of [[packaging_libpthread]]/[[libpthread]].

    <pinotree> once libc is switched internally from cthreads to pthreads (thus
      breaking its BC), may be worth cleanup the hurd-specific exported symbols
    <tschwinge> pinotree: Yes.  If you already have ideas about what to clean
      up, feel free to add a new page or a section on open_issues/glibc.
    <pochu> we're gonna break backwards compatibility in glibc on hurd? that
      could be the perfect moment to fix the /dev/fd/N problem without adding
      new RPCs, though we'd probably have to break backwards-compatibility in
      the exec server IIRC...
    <tschwinge> pochu: Oh, I have to re-read that discussion, but thanks for
      reminding!
