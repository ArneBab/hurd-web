IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-06-01:

    <gnu_srs> Another thing: the lsattr and chattr programs seems to be bogus
      on Hurd. Are they present since they are part of e2fsprogs?
    <youpi> I don't think the Hurd has an interface for it
    <tschwinge> gnu_srs, youpi: lsattr/chattr are extended attributes, right?
      We do have some patches from years ago for adding some support in glibc,
      but they're not yet integrated.  And also we do have a plan for using
      these instead of our Hurd-specific passive translator information in
      inodes.

If interested in working on this, talk to [[tschwinge]], and see these resources:

    <pinotree> notes to self: it seems our ext2 driver comes from linux 2.3.42
      or so, and in linux 2.5.46 ext2/ext3 get xattr and acl support
