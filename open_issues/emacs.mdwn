[[!tag open_issue_porting]]

GNU Emacs mostly does work, however there are a few issues.

  * `dired` on a directory hangs.  (Use `C-g C-g` to break the unresponsive
    operation.)

  * Configuration in `src/s/`: `gnu.h` uses `bsd-common.h`.  `gnu-kfreebsd.h`
    uses `gnu-linux.h` -- we probably should too.

      * `gnu-linux.h` makes a few things depend on `/proc` (also see
        `HAVE_PROCFS`) -- either resort to our own ways, or enhance our
        [[hurd/translator/procfs]] accordingly.

          * `sysdep.c`

  * Got a hang when compiling GNU Emacs 23, when it was compiling `.el` to
    `.elc` files.  Looked like busy-looping inside glibc.  This was not
    reproducible so far.
