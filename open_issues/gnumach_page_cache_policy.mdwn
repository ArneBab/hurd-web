    <braunr> another not-too-long improvement would be changing the page cache
      policy
    <youpi> to drop the 4000 objects limit, you mean ?
    <braunr> yes
    <youpi> do you still have my patch attempt ?
    <braunr> no
    <youpi> let me grab that
    <braunr> oh i won't start it right away you know
    <braunr> i'll ask for it when i do
    <youpi> k
    <braunr> (otherwise i fell i'll just loose it again eh)
    <youpi> :)
    <braunr> but i imagine it's not too hard to achieve
    <youpi> yes
    <braunr> i also imagine to set a large threshold of free pages to avoid
      deadlocks
    <braunr> which will still be better than the current situation where we
      have either lots of free pages because tha max limit is reached, or lots
      of pressure and system freezes :/
    <youpi> yes
