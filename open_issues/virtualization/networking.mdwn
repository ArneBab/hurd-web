# OpenVPN

[[community/meetings/GHM2013]].

OpenVPN can use pfinet's tun as it is, and be configured completely as joe user,
as shown below. Note that the tun0 node name has to begin with "tun", so pfinet
knows it's a tun.

    $ mkdir -p $HOME/servers/socket
    $ touch $HOME/servers/tun0
    $ settrans -ca $HOME/servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet $HOME/servers/tun0 -a 10.0.0.1 -p 10.0.0.2
    $ cat vpn.conf
    client
    dev tun
    dev-node /home/samy/servers/tun0
    ...
    $ openvpn --config vpn.conf --verb 5
    ...

    $ remap /servers/socket/2 $HOME/servers/socket/2
    $ wget www.gnu.org


Ideally openvpn would be made to setup pfinet itself, but at least for now it
can be configured by hand like that.

It would probably be possible to make pfinet able to produce a tap too, would
need some code.

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-07

    <d3f> anyone here knows how /dev/net is handled on the hurd? Programs using
      it say it's not a directory. I tried creating one and setting a netdde
      translator for a tun device in it, but this may be wrong as it doesn't
      work
    <teythoon> d3f: what does /dev/net do?
    <teythoon> ah, its tun/tap stuff...
    <d3f> on my gnu/linux it includes a tun device
    <teythoon> right
    <d3f> I am still reading about the Hurd and try to understand /hurd/netdde
      and devnode but by now I am quite sure I will need those to set a tun
      networktranslator on /dev/net/tun?
    <teythoon> hm, I don't think netdde or devnode will be of any help
    <teythoon> afaiui devnode makes mach devices available in the hurdish way,
      i.e. available for lookup in the filesystem
    <teythoon> d3f: ping youpi if he shows up, he hacked up openvpn to work on
      the hurd
    <d3f> yeah I know, I talked to him as I am tring to get tinc working on the
      Hurd (tinc builds by now). I will give him a shot about creating the
      "tun" device

tun has indeed nothing to do with devnode and netdde, it's pfinet which creates it, as documented above.
