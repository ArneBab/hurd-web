    <youpi> btw, about fakeroot-hurd
    <youpi> the remaining issue I see is with argv[0] (yes, again...)

    <youpi> btw, I believe our fakeroot-hurd is close to working actually
    <youpi> it's just a argv[0] issue supposed to be fixed by exec_file_name
      but apparently not fixed in that case, for some reason
