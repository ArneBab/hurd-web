    <antrik> braunr: do you have any idea what could cause the paging errors
      long before swap is exhausted?
    <braunr> antrik: not really, but i know every project based on the mach vm
      have rewritten their swap pager
    <antrik> (and also I/O performance steadily dropping before that point is
      reached?)
    <antrik> hm
    <braunr> there could too many things
    <antrik> perhaps we could "borrow" from one of them? :-)
    <braunr> map entry fragmentation for example
    <braunr> the freebsd one is the only possible candidate
    <braunr> uvm is too different
    <braunr> dragonflybsd maybe, but it's very close to freebsd
    <braunr> i didn't look at darwin/xnu
