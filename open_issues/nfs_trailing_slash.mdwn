    <gg0> ok, on nfs "mkdir dir0" succeeds, "mkdir dir0/" fails. RPC struct is bad


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-05-27

    <gg0>  150->dir_mkdir ("foo1/" 493) = 0x40000048 (RPC struct is bad) 
    <gg0> task2876->mach_port_deallocate (pn{ 18}) = 0 
    <gg0> mkdir:  136->io_write_request ("mkdir: " -1) = 0 7
    <gg0> cannot create directory `/nfsroot/foo1/' 136->io_write_request
      ("cannot create directory `/nfsroot/foo1/'" -1) = 0 40
    <gg0> : RPC struct is bad 136->io_write_request (": RPC struct is bad" -1)
      = 0 19
    <gg0>  136->io_write_request ("
    <gg0> " -1) = 0 1
    <tschwinge> gg0: Yes, I think we knew about this before.  Nobody felt like
      working on it yet.  Might be a nfs, libnetfs, glibc issue.
    <tschwinge> gg0: If you want to work on it, please ask here or on bug-hurd
      if you need some guidance.
    <gg0> yeah found this thread
      http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2008-04/msg00069.html I don't
      think I'll work on it
