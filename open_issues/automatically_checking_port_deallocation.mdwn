    <youpi> we really need something that is able to automatically check port deallocation
    <youpi> at least for the trivial cases, for which we do have bugs I'm currently fixing...
    <pochu> test suite? :)
    <pochu> won't magically find them though, so not what you've asked for...
    <youpi> test suites can trigger some of the bugs yes
    <youpi> which is already a good thing
    <youpi> of course the coverage can't be perfect
    <youpi> one of the bugs I fixed happened only for setuid binaries for instance
