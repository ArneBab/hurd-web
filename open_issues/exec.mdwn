    <youpi> oh my, disabling gzip/bzip2 support makes apt preconfigure hang
    <youpi> support in exec* I meant

    <youpi> now a funny bug: if I disable gzip/bzip2 support from exec
    <youpi> trying to run a zero-byte file hangs

Justus: This doesn't seem to be an issue anymore (2013-09-08):

    % touch empty
    % chmod +x empty
    % ./empty
    zsh: exec format error: ./empty
    % bash
    $ ./empty
    $ 

Also I've never encountered a problem with apt.

May want to have a look at using BFD / libiberty/simpleobject.

Justus: The BFD code has been removed from the exec server.
