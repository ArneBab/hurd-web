    /dev/hd0s1: Deleted inode 95849 has zero dtime.  FIXED.

This is actually sorta benign.  What typically happens is that one upgrades e.g.
a library, and there are still some processes using it (e.g. because it's libc).
The library file is thus kept on the filesystem, so as to be able to load parts
of it on demand.  The file is thus marked as deleted, but the deletion hasn't
been effective yet, thus dtime being zero. e2fsck notices this and finishes
deleting the file.  To really fix this, we would probably have to really unmount
the filesystem.
