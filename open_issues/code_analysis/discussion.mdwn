    <mcsim> defpager uses it's own dynamic memory allocator, which uses
      vm_allocate/vm_deallocate as backing store? Am I able to use duma in such
      case?
    <braunr> you will have to adapt it
    <braunr> but it's already designed to handle custom allocators
    <braunr> iirc
    <braunr> btw, are there special flags for that memory which the pager
      allocates ?
    <braunr> e.g. to use wired memory ?
    <mcsim> yes, wired memory
    <braunr> you'll have to change that in duma then
    <braunr> but apart from such details, it should be straightforward

    <antrik> braunr: I have no idea about duma; but if you think it's a useful
      tool, please add it to open_issues/code_analysis.mdwn
    <antrik> (I guess we should have a "proper" page listing useful debugging
      tools...)

    <mcsim> hello. Has anyone tried some memory debugging tools like duma or
      dmalloc with hurd?
    <braunr> mcsim: yes, but i couldn't
    <braunr> i tried duma, and it crashes, probably because of cthreads :)


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-09-08

    <mcsim> hello. What static analyzer would you suggest (probably you have
      tried it for hurd already)?
    <braunr> mcsim: if you find some good free static analyzer, let me know :)
    <pinotree> a simple one is cppcheck
    <mcsim> braunr: I'm choosing now between splint and adlint
