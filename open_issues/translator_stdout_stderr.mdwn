There have been several discussions and proposals already, about adding a
suitable logging mechanism to translators, for example.


Decide / implement / fix that (all?) running (passive?) translators' output
should show up on the (Mach / Hurd) console / syslog.

    <youpi> about CLI_DEBUG, you can use #define CLI_DEBUG(fmt, ...) {
      fprintf(stderr, fmt, ## __VA_ARGS__); fflush(stderr); }
    <tschwinge> Isn't stderr in auto-flush mode by default?
    <tschwinge> man setbuf: The standard error stream stderr is always
      unbuffered by default.
    <youpi> tschwinge: "by default" is the important thing here
    <youpi> in the case of translators iirc stderr is buffered
    <tschwinge> youpi: Oh!
    <tschwinge> That sounds wrong.

    <braunr> we'd need a special logging task for hurd servers
    <pinotree> if syslog would work, that could be used optionally
    <braunr> no, it relies on services provided by the hurd
    <braunr> i'm thinking of something using merely the mach interface
    <braunr> e.g. using mach_msg to send log messages to a special port used to
      reference the logging service
    <braunr> which would then store the messages in a circular buffer in ram
    <braunr> maybe sending to syslog if the service is available
    <braunr> the hurd system buffer if you want
