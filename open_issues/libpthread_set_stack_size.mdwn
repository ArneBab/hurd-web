IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-10-21:

    <pinotree> maybe i'm missing something... what's the reason for not
      allowing setting a different stack size in libpthread?

2011-10-23:

    <youpi> pinotree: the threadvars implementations
    <youpi> which needs to find the variables according to sp value
    <youpi> of course, since we now have TLS, threadvards can go away
    <youpi> it's simply on the so-long TODO list

[[glibc/t/tls-threadvar]].
