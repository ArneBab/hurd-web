    <jkoenig> is there a way to get gdb to map addresses as required when debugging mach with qemu ?
    <jkoenig> I can examine the data if I manually map the addresses th 0xc0000000 but maybe there's an easier way...
    <youpi> jkoenig: I haven't found a way
    <youpi> I'm mostly using the internal kdb
