    <kilobug> init=/bin/sh hack doesn't work for GNU/Hurd ?
    <antrik> kilobug: I don't think you can override init on Hurd. the init
      server is actually involved in bootstrapping part of the system core
    <antrik> at some point we discussed the possibility to reduce the Hurd init
      server to *only* do that, and then pass on to standard sysv init... with
      that it could actually work
