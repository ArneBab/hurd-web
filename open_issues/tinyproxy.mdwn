[[!meta title="Problem with using tinyproxy for tunneling HTTPS"]]

`tinyproxy` works fine for HTTP connections, but fails to proxy HTTPS ones:

    ERROR     Jun 12 14:58:51 [20676]: relay_connection: select() error "Interrupted system call". Closing connection (client_fd:7, server_fd:8)

This is supposedly due to the already known select bug, which is a [[!taglink
open_issue_glibc]].
