    <pinotree> hm, is it a known issue that open("somesymlink", O_RDONLY |
      O_NOFOLLOW) does not fail with ELOOP?
    <youpi> pinotree: iirc there is code for it, maybe not the same behavior as
      on linux


## IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2013-05-08

    <pinotree> the hurd issue is that O_NOFOLLOW seems broken on symlinks, and
      thus open(symlink, O_NOFOLLOW) doesn't fail with ELOOP
    <youpi> I don't really see why it should fail
    <youpi> since NOFOLLOW says not to follow the symlink
    <pinotree> yeah, but you cannot open a symlink
    <youpi> ah right ok
    <youpi> interesting :)
