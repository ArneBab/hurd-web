I'd be quite helpful to have nightly builds in form of Debian `.deb`
packages.

  * <http://noone.org/talks/vcs-buildd/> (german)

  * Need to have an automation to get from Hurd upstream Git branches to
    a branch usable in Debian.

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-18:

        <teythoon> http://darnassus.sceen.net/~teythoon/hurd-ci/ has hurd and
          mig and gnumach packages built directly from the upstream git
          repository

There is infrastructure available to test whole OS installations.

[[Debian_Cross_Toolchain]] for cross-building?

# Debian Jenkins Instance

## IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2014-02-24

    <pere> hi.  can hurd be installed using d-i?  If so, what about scripting
      the installation on <URL:
      http://jenkins.debian.net/view/g-i-installation/ >?
    <gnu_srs> pere: d-i works for Hurd, yes, with full graphical interface I
      dunno. Maybe you can ask about scripting in #hurd, more people are
      present there?
    <pere> gnu_srs: the scripts in questions are for jenkins.  quite easy to
      write (d-i preseed scripts and qemu boot rules).

## IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2014-02-25

    <pere> getting a automated test in jenkins running could show the status.
      what is needed to boot the hurd d-i image with a preseed file using qemu?
    <pere> git://git.debian.org/git/users/holger/jenkins.debian.net.git is the
      repo with the jenkins build rules.
    <pere> youpi: is it possible to start the hurd d-i installer with a preseed
      file from the qemu command line?  --append need --kernel, which I suspect
      do not make sense with hurd?
    <pere> can the d-i hurd installer take a preseed file at all?  my initial
      try failed. :(
    <teythoon> i don't know
    <teythoon> there has been talk here the other day about using qemus
      multiboot capabilities to directly boot the hurd

[[debugging_gnumach_startup_qemu_gdb]], *Multiboot*

    <teythoon> i always wanted to try that out
    <pere> the jenkins rules to test the install uses --kernel, --initrd and
      --append in qemu to specify the preseed file.  without a similar method
      to boot hurd, it will be hard to automate the test.  rewriting the iso
      might be an option, but not a very nice one.
    <teythoon> i believe that it is possible to use those options to boot a
      hurd
    <teythoon> i'll report back to you
    <pere> I tried adding an url= option to grub when booting the installer,
      but it seem to be ignored.
    <pere> I suspect it did not make it to /proc/cmdline, but am not sure.
    <teythoon> um
    <teythoon> it should
    <pere> could be.  I am unable to get a shell in the installer, so I do not
      know.
    <teythoon> root@pluto ~ # cat /proc/cmdline
    <teythoon> root=device:hd0s1
    <teythoon> oh ? select expert install, then spawn a shell or something
    <pere> perhaps the preseed udeb is missing, or the network support was
      enabled after preseed looked for the file?
    <teythoon> uh, i don't know about that stuff, youpi creates the d-i images
    <pere> ok.  seem to me that the d-i images do not support preseeding at the
      moment.
    <teythoon> pere: when i try to use qemus multiboot support to boot the
      hurd, qemu crashes :/
    <teythoon> youpi: ^ did you succeed? if so, can you share how?
    <pere> teythoon: nope, I concluded it didn't work, and left it to other to
      fix. :)
    <youpi> pere, teythoon: IIRC preseeding can be put on the gnumach kernel
      command line
    <youpi> but I'm wondering why you can't simply modify the disk image into
      doing what you want
    <youpi> or you mean reinstalling the image each time?
    <pere> youpi: the point is testing the installer, and that can only be done
      by using the installer. :)
    <youpi> ok
    <pere> I would like to see something like <URL:
      http://jenkins.debian.net/view/g-i-installation/job/g-i-installation_debian_sid_daily_lxde/lastBuild/
      > for hurd.
