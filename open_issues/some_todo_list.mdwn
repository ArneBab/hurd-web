[[!tag open_issue_hurd]]

This todo is primarily targetted at the Hurd proper
and applications that rely on the Hurd interfaces.

* psmisc

The tools provided by the psmisc package are linux centric. Killall and pstree, for instance, require Linux's proc file system but could just as easily use Hurd's libps.

* tmpfs
* ppp
* unionfs/stowfs
* supermount translator

From Marcus, 2002:

* xkb driver for console (for international users)
* kbd leds in console (well, in general, Roland's new driver in oskit for that crap)
* fixing tmpfs (it's buggy, Neal says it's Mach's fault)
* adding posix shared memory (requires the io\_close call to be implemented)
* adding posix file locking (requires the io\_close call to be implemented)
* testing
  * find + various filesystems (are inode numbers for . and .. sane?)
  * ext2fs with other block sizes than 4096
  * --help and --version and --usage in all programs
    * I have seen ^V in some --help output, might be argp bug
    * Verify that all options are documented clearly, and that no unimplemented options appear
    * Is the short and long description in the help output correct?
  * Is the return value of all programs correct (eg, does main() return a sane value)
  * Is the suid bit correctly set for all installed programs?
  * Translators
    * Does settrans -g work? -fg?
    * Does stat() work on all translated nodes and give proper data?
    * What about chown, chmod (some translators should pass this through to the underlying node, esp in /dev!)
    * Does statfs give correct data?
    * Are all inode numbers and link counts correct?
* We also should have a "make check" test suite. We can add this once Jeff finished his automake patches
* pick up the other things
  * new console is basically done
    * needs integration of course
    * X switching support
* there is certainly more to do ...

Where difficulty 0 means trivial and 4 means tricky; the difficulty has nothing to do with the importance.
