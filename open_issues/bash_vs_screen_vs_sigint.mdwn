Typing `C-c` (*SIGINT*), different versions of *bash* and *screen* respond like
this:

  * GNU/Linux; Ubuntu package 3.2-5 / `$BASH_VERSION` is `3.2.48(1)-release`
      * plain
          * shell prompt: new line / prompt printed; `$?` is 1.
          * `sleep 10` running: `^C` printed; SIGINT is sent; `$?` is 130.
      * in a *screen* session (Ubuntu package 4.0.3-11ubuntu4): exactly the same.

  * GNU/Hurd; Debian package 3.2-6+b1 (equals 3.2-6) / `$BASH_VERSION` is `3.2.48(1)-release`; *libc0.3* Debian package 2.9-25
      * plain
          * shell prompt: new line / prompt printed; `$?` is 1.
          * `sleep 10` running: `^C` printed; SIGINT is sent; `$?` is 130.
      * in a *screen* session (Debian package 4.0.3-11): exactly the same.
    
    This is equivalent to the GNU/Linux behavior.

  * GNU/Hurd; Debian package 4.0-4 / `$BASH_VERSION` is `4.0.28(1)-release`; *libc0.3* Debian package 2.9-25
      * plain
          * shell prompt: **`^C`, then new line, then `-bash: echo: write error: (ipc/mig) wrong reply message ID`**, then new line / prompt printed; `$?` is **128**.
          * `sleep 10` running: **`^C` printed**, SIGINT is sent; `$?` is 130.
      * in a *screen* session (Debian package 4.0.3-11)
          * shell prompt: **`^C`, then new line / prompt printed**; `$?` is **128**.
          * `sleep 10` running: **`^C` printed**; SIGINT is sent; `$?` is 130.
    
    This differs from the behavior of the earlier *bash* version in the MIG
    error in the not-*screen* case, and in the **128** value for `$?`.  The
    former is an error, and the latter may be as expected.  (Check GNU/Linux
    with that *bash* version.)

  * GNU/Hurd; Debian package 4.0-7 / `$BASH_VERSION` is `4.0.33(1)-release`; *libc0.3* Debian packages 2.9-19, 2.9-25, 2.9-27
      * plain
          * shell prompt: **`^C`, then new line, then `-bash: echo: write error: (ipc/mig) wrong reply message ID`**, then new line / prompt printed; `$?` is **128**.
          * `sleep 10` running: `^C` printed; SIGINT is sent; `$?` is 130.
      * in a *screen* session (Debian package 4.0.3-11)
          * shell prompt: **`^C`**, then new line / prompt printed; `$?` is **128**.
          * `sleep 10` running: `^C` printed; SIGINT is sent; `$?` is 130.
    
    This is equivalent to the *bash* 4.0-4 / 4.0.28(1) behavior.

  * GNU/Hurd; Debian package 4.0-7 / `$BASH_VERSION` is `4.0.33(1)-release`; *libc0.3* Debian package 2.9-27
      * plain
          * shell prompt: **`^C`, then new line, then `-bash: echo: write error: (ipc/mig) wrong reply message ID`**, then new line / prompt printed; `$?` is **128**.
          * `sleep 10` running: `^C` printed; SIGINT is sent; `$?` is 130.
      * in a *screen* session (Debian package 4.0.3-14)
          * shell prompt: **no reaction (nothing printed)**; `$?` thus is **unchanged**.
          * `sleep 10` running: **`^C` printed**, SIGINT is **not** sent.
    
    The *screen* behavior differs.


To sum up:

  * *bash*: 4.0 packages have the MIG error, and the 128 return value difference.

  * *screen*: new package doesn't react to `C-c` anymore.
