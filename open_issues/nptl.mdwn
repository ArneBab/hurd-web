    <tschwinge> Other question: how difficult is a NPTL port?  Futexes and some kernel interfaces for scheduling stuff etc. -- what else?
    <youpi> actually NPTL doesn't _require_ futexes
    <youpi> it just requires low-level locks
    <youpi> Mmm, it seems to be so only in principle
    <youpi> I can see futex names here and there in the generic code
    <youpi> looks like Drepper isn't disciplined enough in that area either
    <tschwinge> (well, why would he...)
    <youpi> I'm not sure we really want to port NPTL
    <tschwinge> OK.
    <youpi> Drepper will keep finding things to add
    <youpi> while the interface between glibc and libpthread isn't increasing _so_ much
    <tschwinge> ... and even less so the interfavce that actual applications are using.
    <tschwinge> We'd need to evaluate which benefits NPTL would bring.

    <gnu_srs> Hi, looks like kfreebsd are now using an NPTL-based pthread
      library: FBTL, http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2013/07/msg00060.html
    <gnu_srs> Anything of interest for porting to Hurd? See also
      http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2013/08/msg00000.html
    <azeem> Petr could've been more verbose in his announcements
    <pinotree> and there's
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/open_issues/nptl.html in our wiki
    <azeem> well, it seems to work fine for kFreeBSD:
      http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2013/07/msg00134.html
    <azeem> and http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2013/07/msg00138.html
