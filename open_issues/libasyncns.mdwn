    <pinotree> tschwinge: btw, would you be able to tell if and what's wrong with a socket-related problem?
    <pinotree> it is reproducible with a very small self-contained C library
    <pinotree> http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/libasyncns/
    <pinotree> it has a test case with it, which fails
    <pinotree> tschwinge: if that can ring some bell, imho the problem is related to SOCK_STREAM sockets created with socketpair and used with send/recv
