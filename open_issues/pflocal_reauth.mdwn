    <pinotree> youpi: i'm playing with pflocal, and noticing that a simple C
      executable doesn't trigger reauthenticate
    <pinotree> youpi: i've put a debug output (to file) in S_io_reauthenticate,
      and with a simple C test (which uses unix sockets) it isn't called
    <youpi> pinotree: it seems pflocal should return FS_RETRY_REAUTH in
      retry_type
    <youpi> to make glibc call reauthentication
    <pinotree> pflocal?
    <youpi> yes, in the dir_lookup handler
    <pinotree> isn't that ext2fs?
    <youpi> libtrivfs had dir_lookup() too
    <youpi> trivfs_check_open_hook can be used to tweak its behavior
    <pinotree> ah, missed that pflocal was using libtrivfs, sorry
    <youpi> there are probably very few translators which don't use one of the
      lib*fs :)
    <antrik> pinotree: what are you trying to do with pflocal?
    <pinotree> local socket scredentials (SCM_CREDS)
    <antrik> ah
    <antrik> don't really know what that is, but I remember reading some
      mention of it ;-)
