    <cfhammar> also I fixed (what I think is) a bug in
      hurd_file_name_lookup_retry when opening FDs with FS_RETRY_MAGIC
    <cfhammar> it didn't actually reopen the FD, rather it just (effectively)
      duped it
    <scolobb> cfhammar: That's great!  I think I had some problems because of
      not being able to truly reopen a port to a file.
    <antrik> cfhammar: what is the difference, and why do you consider it a
      bug?...
    <cfhammar> antrik: for one thing you can't change open modes, and it
      doesn't reset the file cursor
    <cfhammar> (which I actually needed, though I could have done it manually)
    <cfhammar> antrik: and also it isn't consistant with linux
    <cfhammar> you can trigger the bug from the shell: cat /dev/fd/3 3>>
      /tmp/foo
    <antrik> cfhammar: I can't say that I understand the test case... but I can
      at least confirm that it behaves differently on Hurd and on Linux :-)
