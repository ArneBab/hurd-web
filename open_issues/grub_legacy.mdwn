Even though it is customarily used *for* booting GNU/Hurd systems, [[GRUB]],
specifically GRUB legacy (which is still in wide-spread use, despite that
rather depricative nickname), has never been ported to be installable when
attempted to be installed *from* GNU/Hurd systems:

    # grub-install \(hd0\)
    df: Warning: cannot read table of mounted filesystems
    df: Warning: cannot read table of mounted filesystems
    Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.

There is a patch, [[grub-install.patch]], to fix that.


`grub-install`, however, still fails while invoking `grub`:

    # grub-install \(hd0\)
    The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly.

    # grub
    [...]
    grub> dump (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage1 /tmp/grub_stage1
    
    Error 18: Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS
