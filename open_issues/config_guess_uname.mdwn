[[!meta title="config.guess / uname"]]

Same machine; GNU/Hurd running as a Xen domU (this fact very hopefully being
irrelevant):

GNU/Linux:

    $ [...]/config.guess 
    i686-pc-linux-gnu
    $ uname -a
    Linux zenhost 2.6.26-2-xen-686 #1 SMP Sun Jun 21 09:15:17 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux

GNU/Hurd:

    $ [...]/config.guess 
    i386-unknown-gnu0.3
    $ uname -a
    GNU grubber.bddebian.com 0.3 GNU-Mach 1.3.99/Hurd-0.3 i386-AT386 GNU

This causes autoconf-based packages to be configured for i386 instead of i686.

This is very likely a [[!taglink open_issue_gnumach]], and [[tschwinge]] seems
to remember that someone has been looking at this before, but apparently it has
not yet been fixed.
