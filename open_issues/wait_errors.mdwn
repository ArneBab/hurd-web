    <braunr> tschwinge: have you encountered wait() errors ?
    <tschwinge> What kind of wait errors?
    <braunr> when running htop or watch vmstat, other apparently unrelated
      processes calling wait() sometimes fail with an error
    <braunr> i saw it mostly during builds, as they spawn lots of children
    <braunr> (and used the aforementioned commands to monitor the builds)
    <tschwinge> Sounds nasty...  No, don't remember seeing that.  But I don't
      typiclly invoke such commands during builds.
    <tschwinge> So this wait thing suggests there's something going wrong in
      the proc server?
    <braunr> tschwinge: yes
