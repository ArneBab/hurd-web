[[!meta title="IDL"]]

An *IDL* is an *interface definition language* ([[!wikipedia
Interface_description_language desc="Wikipedia article"]]).  A well-known one
is CORBA.  These are [[DSL]]s.

An IDL compiler takes a specification and generates stub code that hides the
transport details, and by this implements a [[RPC]] system.

In the case of [[Mach's MIG|microkernel/mach/mig]], this hides the marshalling
and unmarshalling of procedures' parameters to and from
[[microkernel/mach/message]] format, according to [[microkernel/Mach]]'s
semantics, and invoking the respective [[microkernel/mach/port]] operations.
