# Unless overridden with the `meta' plugin, a footer with licensing information
# will be added to every page using a source file `license' (e.g.,
# `license.mdwn') (using the same ``locating rules'' as for the sidebar
# plugin).
#
# The state which page's license text was gathered from which source is not
# tracked, so you'll need a full wiki-rebuild if the `license' file is changed.
