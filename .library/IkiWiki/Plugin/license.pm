# A footer with licensing information will be added to every rendered page if
# (a) such a footer isn't present already (see the `meta' plugin's ``license''
# facility) and (b) a file `license.html' is found (using the same rules as for
# the sidebar plugin).
#
# The state which page's license text was gathered from which source is not
# tracked, so you'll need a full wiki-rebuild if (b)'s files are changed.
#
# You can use wiki links in `license.html'.
