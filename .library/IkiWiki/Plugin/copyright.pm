# A footer with copyright information will be added to every rendered page if
# (a) such a footer isn't present already (see the `meta' plugin's
# ``copyright'' facility) and (b) a file `copyright.html' is found (using the
# same rules as for the sidebar plugin).
#
# The state which page's copyright text was gathered from which source is not
# tracked, so you'll need a full wiki-rebuild if (b)'s files are changed.
#
# You can use wiki links in `copyright.html'.
