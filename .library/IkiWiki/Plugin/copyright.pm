# Unless overridden with the `meta' plugin, a footer with copyright information
# will be added to every page using a source file `copyright' (e.g.,
# `copyright.mdwn') (using the same ``locating rules'' as for the sidebar
# plugin).
#
# The state which page's copyright text was gathered from which source is not
# tracked, so you'll need a full wiki-rebuild if the `copyright' file is
# changed.
